1946_1	1946_1	To the Congress of the United States:  
1946_3	1946_3	At the same time, it is clear that the budgetary program and the general  program of the Government are actually inseparable. The president bears the  responsibility for recommending to the Congress a comprehensive set of  proposals on all Government activities and their financing. In formulating  policies, as in preparing budgetary estimates, the Nation and the Congress  have the right to expect the President to adjust and coordinate the views  of the various departments and agencies to form a unified program. And that  program requires consideration in connection with the Budget, which is the  annual work program of the Government.  
1946_5	1946_5	For these reasons I have chosen to combine the customary Message on the  State of the Union with the annual Budget Message, and to include in the  Budget not only estimates for functions authorized by the Congress, but  also for those which I recommend for its action.  
1946_16	1946_16	"1945 can see the closing in of the forces of retribution about the center  of the malignant power of imperialistic Japan.  
1946_17	1946_17	"Most important of all 1945 can and must see the substantial beginning of  the organization of world peace."  
1946_18	1946_18	All those hopes, and more, were fulfilled in the year 1945. It was the  greatest year of achievement in human history. It saw the end of the  Nazi_Fascist terror in Europe, and also the end of the malignant power of  Japan. And it saw the substantial beginning of world organization for  peace. These momentous events became realities because of the steadfast  purpose of the United Nations and of the forces that fought for freedom  under their flags. The plain fact is that civilization was saved in 1945 by  the United Nations.  
1946_20	1946_20	Everlasting tribute and gratitude will be paid by all Americans to those  brave men who did not come back, who will never come back the 330,000 who  died that the Nation might live and progress. All Americans will also  remain deeply conscious of the obligation owed to that larger number of  soldiers, sailors, and marines who suffered wounds and sickness in their  service. They may be certain that their sacrifice will never be forgotten  or their needs neglected.  
1946_21	1946_21	The beginning of the year 1946 finds the United States strong and  deservedly confident. We have a record of enormous achievements as a  democratic society in solving problems and meeting opportunities as they  developed. We find ourselves possessed of immeasurable advantages vast and  varied natural resources; great plants, institutions, and other facilities;  unsurpassed technological and managerial skills; an alert, resourceful, and  able citizenry. We have in the United States Government rich resources in  information, perspective, and facilities for doing whatever may be found  necessary to do in giving support and form to the widespread and  diversified efforts of all our people.  
1946_22	1946_22	And for the immediate future the business prospects are generally so  favorable that there is danger of such feverish and opportunistic activity  that our grave postwar problems may be neglected. We need to act now with  full regard for pitfalls; we need to act with foresight and balance. We  should not be lulled by the immediate alluring prospects into forgetting  the fundamental complexity of modern affairs, the catastrophe that can come  in this complexity, or the values that can be wrested from it.  
1946_25	1946_25	Our Nation has always been a land of great opportunities for those people  of the world who sought to become part of us. Now we have become a land of  great responsibilities to all the people of all the world. We must squarely  recognize and face the fact of those responsibilities. Advances in science,  in communication, in transportation, have compressed the world into a  community. The economic and political health of each member of the world  community bears directly on the economic and political health of each other  member.  
1946_26	1946_26	The evolution of centuries has brought us to a new era in world history in  which manifold relationships between nations must be formalized and  developed in new and intricate ways.  
1946_28	1946_28	It is important that the nations come together as States in the Assembly  and in the Security Council and in the other specialized assemblies and  councils that have been and will be arranged. But this is not enough. Our  ultimate security requires more than a process of consultation and  compromise.  
1946_30	1946_30	There are many new responsibilities for us as we enter into this new  international era. The whole power and will and wisdom of our Government  and of our people should be focused to contribute to and to influence  international action. It is intricate, continuing business. Many  concessions and adjustments will be required.  
1946_32	1946_32	On the domestic scene, as well as on the international scene, we must lay a  new and better foundation for cooperation. We face a great peacetime  venture; the challenging venture of a free enterprise economy making full  and effective use of its rich resources and technical advances. This is a  venture in which business, agriculture, and labor have vastly greater  opportunities than heretofore. But they all also have vastly greater  responsibilities. We will not measure up to those responsibilities by the  simple return to "normalcy" that was tried after the last war.  
1946_35	1946_35	As we move toward one common objective there will be many and urgent  problems to meet.  
1946_36	1946_36	Industrial peace between management and labor will have to be  achieved through the process of collective bargaining with Government  assistance but not Government compulsion. This is a problem which is the  concern not only of management, labor, and the Government, but also the  concern of every one of us.  
1946_38	1946_38	Labor also has its own new peacetime responsibilities. Under our collective  bargaining system, which must become progressively more secure, labor  attains increasing political as well as economic power, and this, as with  all power, means increased responsibility.  
1946_47	1946_47	Our most immediate task toward that end is to deprive our enemies  completely and forever of their power to start another war. Of even greater  importance to the preservation of international peace is the need to  preserve the wartime agreement of the United Nations and to direct it into  the ways of peace.  
1946_53	1946_53	It is encouraging to know that the common effort of the United Nations to  learn to live together did not cease with the surrender of our enemies.  
1946_54	1946_54	When difficulties arise among us, the United States does not propose to  remove them by sacrificing its ideals or its vital interests. Neither do we  propose, however, to ignore the ideals and vital interests of our friends.  
1946_56	1946_56	The first meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations now in  progress in London marks the real beginning of our bold adventure toward  the preservation of world peace, to which is bound the dearest hope of  men.  
1946_72	1946_72	7. We believe that all nations should have the freedom of the seas and  equal rights to the navigation of boundary rivers and waterways and of  rivers and waterways which pass through more than one country.  
1946_73	1946_73	8. We believe that all states which are accepted in the society of nations  should have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the  world.  
1946_81	1946_81	On the other side of the world, a method of international cooperation has  recently been agreed upon for the treatment of Japan. In this pattern of  control, the United States, with the full approval of its partners, has  retained primary authority and primary responsibility. It will continue to  do so until the Japanese people, by their own freely expressed choice,  choose their own form of government.  
1946_83	1946_83	At Moscow the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and  Great Britain agreed to further this development by supporting the efforts  of the national government and nongovernmental Chinese political elements  in bringing about cessation of civil strife and in broadening the basis of  representation in the Government. That is the policy which General Marshall  is so ably executing today.  
1946_94	1946_94	In accordance with the intentions of the Congress, lend_lease, except as to  continuing military lend_lease in China, was terminated upon the surrender  of Japan. The first of the lend_lease settlement agreements has been  completed with the United Kingdom. Negotiations with other lend_lease  countries are in progress. In negotiating these agreements, we intend to  seek settlements which will not encumber world trade through war debts of a  character that proved to be so detrimental to the stability of the world  economy after the last war.  
1946_97	1946_97	The view of this Government is that, in the longer run, our economic  prosperity and the prosperity of the whole world are best served by the  elimination of artificial barriers to international trade, whether in the  form of unreasonable tariffs or tariff preferences or commercial quotas or  embargoes or the restrictive practices of cartels.  
1946_101	1946_101	3. OCCUPIED COUNTRIES  
1946_102	1946_102	The major tasks of our Military Establishment in Europe following VE_day,  and in the Pacific since the surrender of Japan, have been those of  occupation and military government. In addition we have given much needed  aid to the peoples of the liberated countries.  
1946_105	1946_105	Improvements in the European economy during 1945 have made it possible for  our military authorities to relinquish to the governments of all liberated  areas, or to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration,  the responsibility for the provision of food and other civilian relief  supplies. The Army's responsibilities in Europe extend now only to our  zones of occupation in Germany and Austria and to two small areas in  northern Italy.  
1946_108	1946_108	For the first time in history the legal culpability of war makers is being  determined. The trials now in progress in Nurnberg_and those soon to begin  in Tokyo bring before the bar of international justice those individuals  who are charged with the responsibility for the sufferings of the past six  years. We have high hope that this public portrayal of the guilt of these  evildoers will bring wholesale and permanent revulsion on the part of the  masses of our former enemies against war, militarism, aggression, and  notions of race superiority.  
1946_109	1946_109	4. DEMOBILIZATION OF OUR ARMED FORCES  
1946_120	1946_120	The War and Navy Departments now estimate that by a year from now we still  will need a strength of about 2 million including officers, for the armed  forces Army, Navy, and Air. I have reviewed their estimates and believe  that the safety of the Nation will require the maintenance of an armed  strength of this size for the calendar year that is before us.  
1946_123	1946_123	I. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK  
1946_125	1946_125	We know, however, that nothing is as dangerous as overconfidence, in war or  in peace. We have had to fight hard to hold the line. We have made  strenuous efforts to speed reconversion. But neither the danger of a  postwar inflation nor of a subsequent collapse in production and employment  is yet overcome. We must base our policies not on unreasoning optimism or  pessimism but upon a candid recognition of our objectives and upon a  careful analysis of foreseeable trends.  
1946_127	1946_127	Civilian production and employment can be expected to increase throughout  the next year. This does not mean, however, that continuing full employment  is assured. It is probable that demobilization of the armed forces will  proceed faster than the increase in civilian employment opportunities. Even  if substantial further withdrawals from the labor market occur,  unemployment will increase temporarily. The extent to which this  unemployment will persist depends largely on the speed of industrial  expansion and the effectiveness of the policies of the Federal Government.  
1946_135	1946_135	While we are meeting these immediate needs we must look forward to a  long_range program of security and increased standard of living.  
1946_140	1946_140	Management has a no less direct interest because on management rests the  responsibility for conducting a growing and prosperous business.  
1946_146	1946_146	Labor and management in many industries have been operating successfully  under the Government's wage_price policy. Upward revisions of wage scales  have been made in thousands of establishments throughout the Nation since  VJ_day. It is estimated that about 6 million workers, or more than 20  percent of all employees in nonagricultural and nongovernmental  establishments, have received wage increases since August 18, 1945. The  amounts of increases given by individual employers concentrate between 10  and 15 percent, but range from less than 5 percent to over 30 percent.  
1946_147	1946_147	The United States Conciliation Service since VJ_day has settled over 3,000  disputes affecting over 1,300,000 workers without a strike threat and has  assisted in settling about 1,300 disputes where strikes were threatened  which involved about 500,000 workers. Only workers directly involved, and  not those in related industries who might have been indirectly affected,  are included in these estimates.  
1946_153	1946_153	We are relying on all concerned to develop, through collective bargaining,  wage structures that are fair to labor, allow for necessary business  incentives, and conform with a policy designed to "hold the line" on  prices.  
1946_158	1946_158	There is no question in my mind that the Government, acting on behalf of  all the people, must assume the ultimate responsibility for the economic  health of the Nation. There is no other agency that can. No other  organization has the scope or the authority, nor is any other agency  accountable, to all the people. This does not mean that the Government has  the sole responsibility, nor that it can do the job alone, nor that it can  do the job directly.  
1946_161	1946_161	In short, the way we handle the proper functions of government, the way we  time the exercise of our traditional and legitimate governmental functions,  has a vital bearing on the economic health of the Nation.  
1946_167	1946_167	(1) Legislation to authorize the President to create fact_finding boards  for the prevention of stoppages of work in Nationwide industries after  collective bargaining and conciliation and voluntary arbitration have  failed as recommended by me on December 3, 1945.  
1946_170	1946_170	(4) Adoption of a permanent Fair Employment Practice Act as recommended by  me on September 6, 1945.  
1946_171	1946_171	(5) Legislation substantially raising the amount of minimum wages now  provided by law as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.  
1946_173	1946_173	(7) Legislation enacting a health and medical care program as recommended  by me on November 19, 1945.  
1946_174	1946_174	(8) Legislation adopting the program of universal training as recommended  by me on October 23, 1945.  
1946_178	1946_178	(12) Legislation for the domestic use and control of atomic energy as  recommended by me on October 3, 1945.  
1946_187	1946_187	(21) Legislation for the development of the Great Lakes_St. Lawrence River  Basin_as recommended by me on October 3, 1945.  
1946_198	1946_198	I am particularly disturbed at the effect such thinking may have on  production and employment. If manufacturers continue to hold back goods and  decline to submit bids when invited as I am informed some are doing in  anticipation of higher prices which would follow the end of price controls,  we shall inevitably slow down production and create needless unemployment.  On the other hand, there are the vast majority of American businessmen who  are not holding back goods, but who need certainty about the Government  pricing policy in order to fix their own long_range pricing policies.  
1946_199	1946_199	Businessmen are entitled therefore to a dear statement of the policy of the  Government on the subject. Tenants and housewives, farmers and  workers consumers in general have an equal right.  
1946_200	1946_200	We are all anxious to eliminate unnecessary controls just as rapidly as we  can do so. The steps that we have already taken in many directions toward  that end are a clear indication of our policy.  
1946_203	1946_203	I do not doubt that the Congress will be beset by many groups who will urge  that the legislation that I have proposed should either be eliminated or  modified to the point where it is nearly useless. The Congress has a clear  responsibility to meet this challenge with courage and determination. I  have every confidence that it will do so.  
1946_204	1946_204	I strongly urge that the Congress now resolve all doubts and as soon as  possible adopt legislation continuing rent and price control in effect for  a full year from June 30, 1946.  
1946_205	1946_205	(b) Food subsidies.  
1946_207	1946_207	In anticipation of this decline in food prices, it was our belief that food  subsidies could be removed gradually during the winter and spring months,  and eliminated almost completely by June 30 of this year. It was our  feeling that the food subsidies could be dropped without an increase to the  consumer in the present level of food prices or in the over_all cost of  living.  
1946_210	1946_210	If prices of food were allowed to increase by these amounts, I must make it  clear to the Congress that, in my opinion, it would become extremely  difficult for us to control the forces of inflation.  
1946_212	1946_212	But I believe our farmers are as deeply conscious as any group in the land  of the havoc which inflation can create. Certainly in the past eighteen  months there has been no group which has fought any harder in support of  the Government's price control program. I am confident that, if the facts  are placed before them and if they see clearly the evils between which we  are forced to choose, they will understand the reasons why subsidies must  be continued.  
1946_213	1946_213	The legislation continuing the use of food subsidies into the new fiscal  year should be tied down specifically to certain standards. A very proper  requirement, in my opinion, would be that subsidies be removed as soon as  it is indicated that the cost of living will decline below the present  levels.  
1946_214	1946_214	(c) Extension of War Powers Act.  
1946_223	1946_223	During the war, the Smaller War Plants Corporation assisted small concerns  to make a maximum contribution to victory. The work of the Smaller War  Plants Corporation is being carried on in peacetime by the Federal Loan  Agency and the Department of Commerce. The fundamental approach to the job  of encouraging small concerns must be based on:  
1946_224	1946_224	1. Arrangements for making private and public financial resources available  on reasonable terms.  
1946_226	1946_226	3. Elimination of trade practices and agreements which reduce competition  and discriminate against new or small enterprises.  
1946_231	1946_231	But we must do more than break up trusts and monopolies after they have  begun to strangle competition. We must take positive action to foster new,  expanding enterprises. By legislation and by administration we must take  specific steps to discourage the formation or the strengthening of  competition_restricting business. We must have an over_all antimonopoly  policy which can be applied by all agencies of the Government in exercising  the functions assigned to them a policy designed to encourage the  formation and growth of new and freely competitive enterprises.  
1946_235	1946_235	(e) Minimum wage.  
1946_241	1946_241	Today about 20 percent of our manufacturing wage earners or about 2  million_earn less than 65 cents an hour. Because wages in most industries  have risen during the war, this is about the same as the proportion_17  percent who were earning less than 40 cents an hour in 1941.  
1946_243	1946_243	Lifting the basic minimum wage is necessary, it is justified as a matter of  simple equity to workers, and it will prove not only feasible but also  directly beneficial to the Nation's employers.  
1946_244	1946_244	(f) Agricultural programs.  
1946_247	1946_247	Farm prices are expected to remain at least at their present levels in the  immediate future, and for at least the next 12 months they are expected to  yield a net farm income double the 1935_39 average and higher than in any  year prior to 1943.  
1946_249	1946_249	Agricultural production goals for 1946 call for somewhat greater acreage  than actually was planted in 1945. Agriculture is prepared to demonstrate  that it can make a peacetime contribution as great as its contribution  toward the winning of the war.  
1946_251	1946_251	For the period immediately ahead we shall still have the problem of  supplying enough food. If we are to do our part in aiding the war_stricken  and starving countries some of the food desires of our own people will not  be completely satisfied, at least until these nations have had an  opportunity to harvest another crop. During the next few months the need  for food in the world will be more serious than at any time during the war.  And, despite the large shipments we have already made, and despite what we  shall send, there remain great needs abroad.  
1946_252	1946_252	Beyond the relief feeding period, there will still be substantial foreign  outlets for our farm commodities. The chief dependence of the farmer,  however, as always, must be upon the buying power of our own people.  
1946_257	1946_257	For example, one of the best possible contributions toward building a  stronger, healthier Nation would be a permanent school_lunch program on a  scale adequate to assure every school child a good lunch at noon. The  Congress, of course, has recognized this need for a continuing school_lunch  program and legislation to that effect has been introduced and hearings  held. The plan contemplates the attainment of this objective with a minimum  of Federal expenditures. I hope that the legislation will be enacted in  time for a permanent program to start with the beginning of the school year  next fall.  
1946_258	1946_258	We have the technical knowledge and the productive capacity to provide  plenty of good food for every man, woman, and child in the United States.  It is time we made that possibility a reality.  
1946_259	1946_259	(g) Resource development.  
1946_265	1946_265	The Congress has shown itself alive to the practical requirements for a  beneficial use of our water resources by providing that preference in the  sale of power be given to farmers' cooperatives and public agencies. The  public power program thus authorized must continue to be made effective by  building the necessary generating and transmission facilities to furnish  the maximum of firm power needed at the wholesale markets, which are often  distant from the dam sites.  
1946_267	1946_267	(h) Public works.  
1946_272	1946_272	The Congress has already made provision for highway programs. It is now  considering legislation which would expand Federal grants and loans in  several other fields, including construction of airports, hospital and  health centers, housing, water pollution control facilities, and  educational plant facilities. I hope that early action will be taken to  authorize these Federal programs.  
1946_275	1946_275	Our long_run objective is to achieve a program of direct Federal and  Federally assisted public works which is planned in advance and  synchronized with business conditions. In this way it can make its greatest  contribution to general economic stability.  
1946_277	1946_277	Last September I stated in my message to the Congress that housing was high  on the list of matters calling for decisive action.  
1946_280	1946_280	Since VJ_day the wartime housing shortage has been growing steadily worse  and pressure on real estate values has increased. Returning veterans often  cannot find a satisfactory place for their families to live, and many who  buy have to pay exorbitant prices. Rapid demobilization inevitably means  further overcrowding.  
1946_283	1946_283	As a result of the housing shortage, it is inevitable that the present  dangers of inflation in home values will continue unless the Congress takes  action in the immediate future.  
1946_285	1946_285	Such measures are necessary stopgaps_but only stopgaps. This emergency  action, taken alone, is good but not enough. The housing shortage did not  start with the war or with demobilization; it began years before that and  has steadily accumulated. The speed with which the Congress establishes the  foundation for a permanent, long_range housing program will determine how  effectively we grasp the immense opportunity to achieve our goal of decent  housing and to make housing a major instrument of continuing prosperity and  full employment in the years ahead. It will determine whether we move  forward to a stable and healthy housing enterprise and toward providing a  decent home for every American family.  
1946_286	1946_286	Production is the only fully effective answer. To get the wheels turning, I  have appointed an emergency housing expediter. I have approved  establishment of priorities designed to assure an ample share of scarce  materials to builders of houses for which veterans will have preference.  Additional price and wage adjustments will be made where necessary, and  other steps will be taken to stimulate greater production of bottleneck  items. I recommend consideration of every sound method for expansion in  facilities for insurance of privately financed housing by the Federal  Housing Administration and resumption of previously authorized low_rent  public housing projects suspended during the war.  
1946_289	1946_289	These principles place paramount the fact that housing construction and  financing for the overwhelming majority of our citizens should be done by  private enterprise. They contemplate also that we afford governmental  encouragement to privately financed house construction for families of  moderate income, through extension of the successful system of insurance of  housing investment; that research be undertaken to develop better and  cheaper methods of building homes; that communities be assisted in  appraising their housing needs; that we commence a program of Federal aid,  with fair local participation, to stimulate and promote the rebuilding and  redevelopment of slums and blighted areas with maximum use of private  capital. It is equally essential that we use public funds to assist  families of low income who could not otherwise enjoy adequate housing, and  that we quicken our rate of progress in rural housing.  
1946_290	1946_290	Legislation now under consideration by the Congress provides for a  comprehensive attack jointly by private enterprise, State and local  authorities, and the Federal Government. This legislation would make  permanent the National Housing Agency and give it authority and funds for  much needed technical and economic research. It would provide additional  stimulus for privately financed housing construction. This stimulus  consists of establishing a new system of yield insurance to encourage  large_scale investment in rental housing and broadening the insuring powers  of the Federal Housing Administration and the lending powers of the Federal  savings and loan associations.  
1946_292	1946_292	Prompt enactment of permanent housing legislation along these lines will  not interfere with the emergency action already under way. On the contrary,  it would lift us out of a potentially perpetual state of housing emergency.  It would offer the best hope and prospect to millions of veterans and other  American families that the American system can offer more to them than  temporary makeshifts.  
1946_294	1946_294	(j) Social security and health.  
1946_295	1946_295	Our Social Security System has just celebrated its tenth anniversary.  During the past decade this program has supported the welfare and morale of  a large part of our people by removing some of the hazards and hardships of  the aged, the unemployed, and widows and dependent children.  
1946_296	1946_296	But, looking back over 10 years' experience and ahead to the future, we  cannot fail to see defects and serious inadequacies in our system as it now  exists. Benefits are in many cases inadequate; a great many persons are  excluded from coverage; and provision has not been made for social  insurance to cover the cost of medical care and the earnings lost by the  sick and the disabled.  
1946_298	1946_298	We must take urgent measures for the readjustment period ahead. The  Congress for some time has been considering legislation designed to  supplement at Federal expense, during the immediate reconversion period,  compensation payments to the unemployed. Again I urge the Congress to enact  legislation liberalizing unemployment compensation benefits and extending  the coverage. Providing for the sustained consumption by the unemployed  persons and their families is more than a welfare policy; it is sound  economic policy. A sustained high level of consumer purchases is a basic  ingredient of a prosperous economy.  
1946_300	1946_300	The comprehensive health program which I recommended on November 19, 1945,  will require substantial additions to the Social Security System and, in  conjunction with other changes that need to be made, will require further  consideration of the financial basis for social security. The system of  prepaid medical care which I have recommended is expected eventually to  require amounts equivalent to 4 percent of earnings up to $3,600 a year,  which is about the average of present expenditures by individuals for  medical care. The pooling of medical costs, under a plan which permits each  individual to make a free choice of doctor and hospital, would assure that  individuals receive adequate treatment and hospitalization when they are  faced with emergencies for which they cannot budget individually. In  addition, I recommended insurance benefits to replace part of the earnings  lost through temporary sickness and permanent disability.  
1946_304	1946_304	In the future we expect incomes considerably higher than before the war.  Higher incomes should make it possible for State and local governments and  for individuals to support higher and more nearly adequate expenditures for  education. But inequality among the States will still remain, and Federal  help will still be needed.  
1946_307	1946_307	(l) Federal Government personnel.  
1946_309	1946_309	At the same time that we have curtailed the number of employees, we have  shortened the workweek by one_sixth or more throughout the Government and  have restored holidays. The process of readjustment has been complicated  and costs have been increased by a heavy turn_over in the remaining  personnel particularly by the loss of some of our best administrators.  Thousands of war veterans have been reinstated or newly employed in the  civil service. Many civilians have been transferred from war agencies to  their former peacetime agencies. Recruitment standards, which had to be  relaxed during the war, are now being tightened.  
1946_319	1946_319	SUMMARY OF THE BUDGET  
1946_321	1946_321	Expenditures of all kinds, authorized and recommended, in the next year are  estimated at just above 35.8 billion dollars. Net receipts are estimated at  31.5 billion dollars. The estimated difference of 4.3 billion dollars will  be met by a reduction in the very substantial balance which will be in the  Treasury during the next fiscal year.  
1946_323	1946_323	To elaborate, the Budget, as I have remarked above, reflects on both sides  of the ledger the Government's program as recommended by the Executive. It  includes estimates not only of expenditures and receipts for which  legislative authority already exists, but also of expenditures and receipts  for which authorization is recommended.  
1946_331	1946_331	1940 9,252  
1946_332	1946_332	Although allowances for occupation, demobilization, and defense are  drastically reduced in the fiscal year 1947, they will still amount to 42  percent of the total Budget. The so_called "aftermath of war" expenditures  account for a further 30 percent of the total. The total of all other  programs, which was drastically cut during the war, is increasing again as  liquidation of the war program proceeds and renewed emphasis is placed on  the peacetime objectives of the Government.  
1946_334	1946_334	As a result, estimated expenditures will exceed estimated receipts by 4.3  billion dollars. This amount can be provided by a reduction in the cash  balance in the Treasury. Thus, after a long period of increasing public  debt resulting from depression budgets and war budgets, it is anticipated  that no increase in the Federal debt will be required next year.

1946_348	1946_348	The current fiscal year, 1946, is a year of transition. When the year  opened, in July 1945, we were still fighting a major war, and Federal  expenditures were running at an annual rate of about 100 billion dollars.  By June 1946 that rate will be more than cut in half. The Budget total for  the current fiscal year is now estimated at 67.2 billion dollars, of which  more than two_thirds provides for war and war liquidation. Since net  receipts are estimated at 38.6 billion dollars, there will be an excess of  expenditures of 28.6 billion dollars for the current fiscal year.  
1946_351	1946_351	Similarly, only over_all estimates are provided for new programs  recommended in this Message; detailed recommendations will be transmitted  after authorizing legislation has been enacted. It should be recognized  that many of the estimates for new programs recommended in this Message are  initial year figures. These figures will be affected by the date the  legislation is enacted and by the time needed for getting a program under  way. New programs, such as that for a national research agency, will  require larger amounts in later years. The estimates exclude major elements  of the proposed national health program since the greater part of these  will be covered by expenditures from trust funds.  
1946_359	1946_359	The wartime annual rate of Federal expenditures has been reduced by 32  billion dollars, while the Nation's budget total has dropped only half as  much. The drop in total value of production and services has been less  drastic because increasing private activities have absorbed in large  measure the manpower and materials released from war production and war  services.

1946_399	1946_399	In general, the drastic cut in war programs has thrown the economy into  lower gear; it has not thrown it out of gear. Our economic machine  demonstrates remarkable resiliency, although there are many difficulties  that must still be overcome. The rapid termination of war contracts, prompt  clearance of unneeded Government_owned equipment from private plants, and  other reconversion policies have greatly speeded up the beginning of  peacetime work in reconverted plants.  
1946_401	1946_401	The Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion  analyzes the difficulties in recruiting personnel and obtaining materials  that hamper reconversion in certain industries and proposes policies to  deal with these situations. The lack of adequate housing is one of the main  factors checking the flow of workers into areas where job opportunities  exist.  
1946_412	1946_412	Moreover, inflationary pressures still appear dangerously powerful, and  ill_advised tax reduction would operate to strengthen them still further.  
1946_413	1946_413	My decision not to recommend additional tax reductions at this time is made  in the light of existing economic conditions and prospects.

1946_427	1946_427	Although the public debt is expected to decline, a substantial volume of  refinancing will be required, because of the large volume of maturing  obligations. Redemptions of savings bonds also have been running high in  recent months and are expected to remain large for some time. The issuance  of savings bonds will be continued. These bonds represent a convenient  method of investment for small savers, and also an anti_inflationary method  of refinancing. Government agencies and trust funds are expected to buy  about 2.5 billion dollars of Government securities during the next 6  months, and 2.8 billion dollars more during the fiscal year 1947. Through  these and other debt operations, the distribution of the Federal debt among  the various types of public and private owners will change, even though the  total is expected to decline.  
1946_436	1946_436	(a) War expenditures.  
1946_452	1946_452	During the war, authorizations and appropriations had to be enacted well in  advance of obligation and spending to afford ample time for planning of  production by the procurement services and by industry. Thus our cumulative  war program authorized in the period between July 1, 1940, and July 1,  1945, was 431 billion dollars, including net war commitments of Government  corporations. Expenditures against those authorizations totaled 290 billion  dollars. This left 141 billion dollars in unobligated authorizations and  unliquidated obligations.  
1946_453	1946_453	With the end of fighting, it became necessary to adjust war authorizations  to the requirements of war liquidation and continuing national defense.  Intensive review of the war authorizations by both the executive and the  legislative branches has been continued since VJ_day. As a result, the  authorized war program is being brought more nearly into line with  expenditures.  
1946_454	1946_454	Recisions and authorizations through the fiscal year 1946. Readjusting the  war program, as the Congress well knows, is not an easy task.  Authorizations must not be too tight, lest we hamper necessary operations;  they must not be too ample, lest we lose control of spending. Last  September, I transmitted to the Congress recommendations on the basis of  which the Congress voted H.R. 4407 to repeal 50.3 billion dollars of  appropriations and authorizations. I found it necessary to veto this bill  because it was used as a vehicle for legislation that would impair the  reemployment program. However, in order to preserve the fine work of the  Congress on the recisions, I asked the Director of the Bureau of the Budget  to place the exact amounts indicated for repeal in a nonexpendable reserve,  and to advise the departments and agencies accordingly. This has been  done.  
1946_455	1946_455	In accord with Public Law 132 of the Seventy_ninth Congress, I have  transmitted recommendations for additional rescissions for the current  fiscal year of appropriations amounting to 5.8 billion dollars and of  contract authorizations totaling 420 million dollars. The net reduction in  authority to obligate will be 5.0 billion dollars, because, of the  appropriations, 1.2 billion dollars will have to be restored in subsequent  years to liquidate contract authorizations still on the books.  
1946_456	1946_456	The appropriations recommended for repeal include 2,827 million dollars for  the Navy Department, 1,421 million dollars for the War Department, 850  million dollars for lend_lease, 384 million dollars for the War Shipping  Administration, and 260 million dollars for the United States Maritime  Commission. The contract authorizations proposed for repeal are for the  Maritime Commission.  
1946_459	1946_459	On the other hand, supplemental appropriations of 600 million dollars will  be required for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation  Administration.  
1946_460	1946_460	In the net, it is estimated that the cumulative authorized war and national  defense program will amount to 368 billion dollars on June 30, 1946.  Expenditures of 49 billion dollars during the fiscal year 1946 will have  pushed cumulative expenditures to 339 billion dollars. The unexpended  balances will be down to 28 billion dollars on June 30, 1946.  
1946_470	1946_470	"Veterans' pensions and benefits" has become one of the largest single  categories in the Federal Budget. I am recommending for this purpose total  appropriations of 4,787 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947.  Expenditures in the fiscal year are estimated, under present legislation,  at 4,208 million dollars. These expenditures will help our veterans through  their readjustment period and provide lasting care for those who were  disabled.  
1946_471	1946_471	The Congress has provided unemployment allowances for veterans during their  readjustment period. Expenditure of 850 million dollars for this purpose is  anticipated for the fiscal year 1947. In addition, readjustment allowances  for self_employed veterans are expected to cost 340 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947.  
1946_472	1946_472	On May 28, 1945, in asking the Congress to raise the ceiling on benefits  for civilian unemployed to not less than 25 dollars a week during the  immediate reconversion period, I suggested that the Congress also consider  liberalizing veterans' allowances. Elsewhere in this Message I reiterate my  recommendation with respect to emergency unemployment compensation. I also  recommend increasing veterans' unemployment allowances from 20 dollars to  25 dollars a week. This would involve additional expenditures estimated at  approximately 220 million dollars for the fiscal year.  
1946_474	1946_474	The ultimate benefit which veterans receive from the loan guarantee  provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act depends largely on the  success of our stabilization program in restraining building costs and real  estate values. Under the revised procedure contained in recent amendments,  the administrative workload will be minimized by the almost complete  transfer of authority for approving the guarantees to private lending  agencies and private appraisers designated by the Veterans Administration.  This authority carries with it the responsibility for restricting the  guarantees to loans on reasonably valued properties. Costs of the program,  other than for administration, are estimated at 21 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947.  
1946_478	1946_478	(b) For interest.  
1946_482	1946_482	This category of expenditures is thus losing gradually its  "aftermath_of_war" character, and by the succeeding year will reflect  almost entirely the normal operation of loss carry_backs and current tax  collection.  
1946_486	1946_486	To provide for the expenditures from general and special accounts, I  recommend for the fiscal year 1947 appropriations of million dollars  (including the existing permanent appropriation of an amount equal to 30  percent of estimated annual customs receipts) and a reappropriation of 88  million dollars of prior_year balances from customs receipts. In addition  there is a recommended authorization of 367.5 million dollars for borrowing  from the Reconstruction finance Corporation for the loan programs of the  farm Security Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration.  It is expected that the operations of the Commodity Credit Corporation will  be financed during the coming year through the 500 million dollars of  lend_lease funds which the Congress has earmarked for price support  purposes, a supplemental appropriation to restore impaired capital of the  Corporation, and the borrowing authority of the Corporation.  
1946_495	1946_495	Federal capital outlays for transportation facilities are expected to  approximate 519 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947. State and local  governments may spend 400 million dollars. Private investment, over half of  it by railways, may approach 1,150 million dollars.  
1946_496	1946_496	The Congress has already taken steps for the resumption of work on  improvement of rivers and harbors and on the construction of new  Federal_aid highways. Much needed work on airports can begin when the  Congress enacts legislation now in conference between the two Houses.  
1946_497	1946_497	The Federal expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 1947 include 53  million dollars for new construction in rivers, harbors, and the Panama  Canal and 291 million dollars for highways and grade_crossing elimination,  assuming that the States expend some 275 million dollars on the Federal_aid  system. Additional expenditures for highways totaling 36 million dollars  are anticipated by the forest Service, National Park Service, and the  Territory of Alaska. Civil airways and airports will involve expenditures  of 35 million dollars under existing authority. Additional Federal  expenditures exceeding 20 million dollars (to be matched by States and  municipalities) may be made during the fiscal year 1947 under the airport  legislation now in conference between the two Houses of the Congress.  
1946_499	1946_499	The estimates for the United States Maritime Commission and War Shipping  Administration provide for the transition of shipping operation from a war  to a peace basis; the sale, chartering, or lay_up of much of the war_built  fleet; and for a program of ship construction of some 84 million dollars in  the fiscal year 1947 to round out the merchant fleet for peacetime use.  
1946_503	1946_503	The reclamation and flood control projects which I am recommending for the  fiscal year 1947 will involve capital outlays of approximately 319 million  dollars as compared with 245 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946. These  expenditures cover programs of the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of  Reclamation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Agriculture,  and the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and  Mexico. A number of these projects are multiple_purpose projects, providing  not only for reclamation and irrigation of barren land and flood control,  but also for the production of power needed for industrial development of  the areas.  
1946_504	1946_504	Expenditures for power transmission and distribution facilities by the  Bonneville Power Administration are expected to increase from 12 million  dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 15 million dollars in the next fiscal  year. In addition, the Southwestern Power Administration will undertake a  new program involving expenditures of about 16 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947. The Rural Electrification Administration will require  expenditures during the current fiscal year estimated at 156 million  dollars; in the fiscal year 1947, at 241 million dollars.  
1946_505	1946_505	The TVA program includes completion of major multiple_purpose  projects navigation, flood control, and power facilities and additions to  chemical plants and related facilities. Expenditures for these capital  improvement programs are estimated at 30 million dollars in the fiscal year  1946 and 39 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947.  
1946_513	1946_513	The Budget provides for continuation and desirable expansion of the  research activities that are carried on throughout the Federal  establishment and through previously authorized grants to the States.  Additional appropriations will be required for the proposed central Federal  research agency which I recommended last September 6. That agency will  coordinate existing research activities and administer funds for new  research activities wherever they are needed; it will not itself conduct  research. The plan contemplates expenditures through the new research  agency of approximately 40 million dollars for the first year.  
1946_514	1946_514	These amounts are small in relation to the important contribution they can  make to the national income, the welfare of our people, and the common  defense. Expenditures must be limited for the time being by the capacity of  research agencies to make wise use of funds. The maintenance of our  position as a nation, however, will require more emphasis on research  expenditures in the future than in the past.  
1946_515	1946_515	Educational expenditures will require a significant share of the national  income in the fiscal year 1947. State, local, and private expenditures for  the current support of elementary, secondary, and higher education are  expected to be substantially above 3 billion dollars in that year. These  nonfederal expenditures will be supplemented by Federal expenditures  estimated at 625 million dollars in the present Budget. Of this amount, the  estimate for veterans' education, as previously mentioned, is 535 million  dollars. Other amounts include 21 million dollars for the support of  vocational education in public schools, 5 million dollars for the  land_grant colleges, 50 million dollars for the present school_lunch and  milk program, 1 million dollars for the Office of Education, and  approximately 13 million dollars for various other items. In view of the  major policy issues which are still under study by the Congress and the  Administration, no specific amount has been determined for the Federal  grants, previously recommended in this Message, which would assist the  States generally in assuring more nearly equal opportunities for a good  education.  
1946_516	1946_516	Notwithstanding the urgent need for additional school and college  buildings, careful planning will be required for the expenditures to be  made under the proposed legislation to aid the States in providing  educational facilities. A major share of the grants for the first year  would be for surveys and plans.  
1946_517	1946_517	I have already outlined the broad objectives of our foreign economic  policy. In the present section I shall indicate the Federal outlays which  the execution of these programs may require in the fiscal years 1946 and  1947.  
1946_518	1946_518	(a) On the termination of lend_lease, the lend_lease countries were  required to pay for goods in the lend_lease pipe line either in cash or by  borrowing from the United States or by supplying goods and services to the  United States. Credits for this purpose have already been extended to  Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium amounting to 675 million  dollars. The settlement credit of 650 million dollars to the United Kingdom  includes an amount preliminarily fixed at 118 million dollars which  represents the excess of purchases by the United Kingdom from the pipe line  over goods and services supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States  since VJ_day and the balance of various claims by one government against  the other.  
1946_532	1946_532	Other increases are for civil aeronautics promotion, the business and  manufacturing censuses, and other expanded business services of the  Department of Commerce which have been referred to above; the forest and  Soil Conservation Services and other committees of the Department of  certain conservation activities of the Department of the Interior; and the  collection of internal revenue in the Treasury Department.  
1946_533	1946_533	The necessity for reestablishing postal services curtailed during the war  and advances in the rates of pay for postal employees have increased  substantially the estimated expenditures for postal service for both the  current and the next fiscal year. It is not expected that this increase  will cause expenditures to exceed postal revenues in either year, although  an excess of expenditures may occur in the fiscal year 1947 if salaries are  increased further.  
1946_537	1946_537	It should be impossible for any man to contemplate without a sense of  personal humility the tremendous events of the 12 months since the last  annual Message, the great tasks that confront us, the new and huge problems  of the coming months and years. Yet these very things justify the deepest  confidence in the future of this Nation of free men and women.  
1946_539	1946_539	As printed above, references to tables appearing in the budget document  have been omitted.  
1947_6	1947_6	If in this year, and in the next, we can find the right course to take as  each issue arises, and if, in spite of all difficulties, we have the  courage and the resolution to take that course, then we shall achieve a  state of well_being for our people without precedent in history. And if we  continue to work with the other nations of the world earnestly, patiently,  and wisely, we can granting a will for peace on the part of our  neighbors_make a lasting peace for the world.  
1947_11	1947_11	As the year 1947 begins, the state of our national economy presents great  opportunities for all. We have virtually full employment. Our national  production of goods and services is 50 percent higher than in any year  prior to the war emergency. The national income in 1946 was higher than in  any peacetime year. Our food production is greater than it has ever been.  During the last 5 years our productive facilities have been expanded in  almost every field. The American standard of living is higher now than ever  before, and when the housing shortage can be overcome it will be even  higher.  
1947_17	1947_17	An important present source of danger to our economy is the possibility  that prices might be raised to such an extent that the consuming public  could not purchase the tremendous volume of goods and services which will  be produced during 1947.  
1947_18	1947_18	We all know that recent price increases have denied to many of our workers  much of the value of recent wage increases. Farmers have found that a large  part of their increased income has been absorbed by increased prices. While  some of our people have received raises in income which exceed price  increases, the great majority have not. Those persons who live on modest  fixed incomes retired persons living on pensions, for example and workers  whose incomes are relatively inflexible, such as teachers and other civil  servants have suffered hardship.  
1947_25	1947_25	Second, restriction of monopoly and unfair business practices; assistance  to small business; and the promotion of the free competitive system of  private enterprise.  
1947_26	1947_26	Third, continuation of an aggressive program of home construction.  
1947_29	1947_29	LABOR AND MANAGEMENT  
1947_31	1947_31	Despite this outbreak of economic warfare in 1946, we are today producing  goods and services in record volume. Nevertheless, it is essential to  improve the methods for reaching agreement between labor and management and  to reduce the number of strikes and lockouts.  
1947_33	1947_33	We must remember, in reviewing the record of disputes in 1946, that  management shares with labor the responsibility for failure to reach  agreements which would have averted strikes. For that reason, we must  realize that industrial peace cannot be achieved merely by laws directed  against labor unions.  
1947_35	1947_35	That is still the national policy.  
1947_36	1947_36	And it should continue to be the national policy!  
1947_39	1947_39	We should enact legislation to correct certain abuses and to provide  additional governmental assistance in bargaining. But we should also  concern ourselves with the basic causes of labor_management difficulties.  
1947_41	1947_41	Point number one is the early enactment of legislation to prevent certain  unjustifiable practices.  
1947_45	1947_45	A second unjustifiable practice is the secondary boycott, when used to  further jurisdictional disputes or to compel employers to violate the  National Labor Relations Act.  
1947_47	1947_47	A third practice that should be corrected is the use of economic force, by  either labor or management, to decide issues arising out of the  interpretation of existing contracts.  
1947_48	1947_48	Collective bargaining agreements, like other contracts, should be  faithfully adhered to by both parties. In the most enlightened  union_management relationships, disputes over the interpretation of  contract terms are settled peaceably by negotiation or arbitration.  Legislation should be enacted to provide machinery whereby unsettled  disputes concerning the interpretation of an existing agreement may be  referred by either party to final and binding arbitration.  
1947_49	1947_49	Point number two is the extension of facilities within the Department of  Labor for assisting collective bargaining.  
1947_51	1947_51	Point number three is the broadening of our program of social legislation  to alleviate the causes of workers' insecurity.  
1947_53	1947_53	Point number four is the appointment of a Temporary Joint Commission to  inquire into the entire field of labor_management relations.  
1947_63	1947_63	RESTRICTION Of MONOPOLY AND PROMOTION OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE  
1947_65	1947_65	During the war, this long_standing tendency toward economic concentration  was accelerated. As a consequence, we now find that to a greater extent  than ever before, whole industries are dominated by one or a few large  organizations which can restrict production in the interest of higher  profits and thus reduce employment and purchasing power.  
1947_67	1947_67	To strengthen and enforce the laws that regulate business practices is not  enough. Enforcement must be supplemented by positive measures of aid to new  enterprises. Government assistance, research programs, and credit powers  should be designed and used to promote the growth of new firms and new  industries. Assistance to small business is particularly important at this  time when thousands of veterans who are potential business and industrial  leaders are beginning their careers.  
1947_70	1947_70	The third major policy is also of great importance to the national economy:  an aggressive program to encourage housing construction. The first federal  program to relieve the veterans' housing shortage was announced in February  1946. In 1946 one million family housing units have been put under  construction and more than 665,000 units have already been completed. The  rate of expansion in construction has broken all records.  
1947_73	1947_73	FISCAL AFFAIRS  
1947_74	1947_74	The fourth major policy has to do with the balancing of the budget. In a  prosperous period such as the present one, the budget of the Federal  Government should be balanced. Prudent management of public finance  requires that we begin the process of reducing the public debt. The budget  which I shall submit to you this week has a small margin of surplus. In the  Budget Message I am making recommendations which, if accepted, will result  in a substantially larger surplus which should be applied to debt  retirement. One of these recommendations is that the Congress take early  action to continue throughout the next fiscal year the war excise tax rates  which, under the present law, will expire on June 30, 1947.  
1947_75	1947_75	Expenditures relating to the war are still high. Considerable sums are  required to alleviate world famine and suffering. Aid to veterans will  continue at peak level. The world situation is such that large military  expenditures are required. Interest on the public debt and certain other  costs are irreducible. For these reasons I have had to practice stringent  economy in preparing the budget; and I hope that the Congress will  cooperate in this program of economy.  
1947_76	1947_76	AGRICULTURE  
1947_78	1947_78	Production of food reached record heights in 1946. Much of our tremendous  grain crop can readily be sold abroad and thus will become no threat to our  domestic markets. But in the next few years American agriculture can face  the same dangers it did after World War I. In the early twenties the Nation  failed to maintain outlets for the new productive capacity of our  agricultural plant. It failed to provide means to protect the farmer while  he adjusted his acreage to peacetime demands.  
1947_79	1947_79	The result we all remember too well. Farm production stayed up while demand  and prices fell, in contrast with industry where prices stayed up and  output declined, farm surpluses piled up, and disaster followed.  
1947_81	1947_81	The purpose of these laws was to permit an orderly transition from war to  peace. The Government plan of support prices was not designed to absorb, at  great cost, the unlimited surpluses of a highly productive agriculture.  
1947_82	1947_82	We must not wait until the guarantees expire to set the stage for permanent  farm welfare.  
1947_83	1947_83	The farmer is entitled to a fair income.  
1947_91	1947_91	Exclusive of mustering_out payments and terminal leave pay, the program for  veterans of all wars is costing over seven billion dollars a  year one_fifth of our total federal budget. This is the most far_reaching  and complete veterans program ever conceived by any nation.  
1947_92	1947_92	Except for minor adjustments, I believe that our program of benefits for  veterans is now complete. In the long run, the success of the program will  not be measured by the number of veterans receiving financial aid or by the  number of dollars we spend. History will judge us not by the money we  spend, but by the further contribution we enable our veterans to make to  their country. In considering any additional legislation, that must be our  criterion.  
1947_93	1947_93	CIVIL RIGHTS  
1947_95	1947_95	The will to fight these crimes should be in the hearts of every one of us.  
1947_99	1947_99	NATURAL RESOURCES  
1947_102	1947_102	FOREIGN AFFAIRS  
1947_107	1947_107	Our policy toward the Soviet Union is guided by the same principles which  determine our policies toward all nations. We seek only to uphold the  principles of international justice which have been embodied in the Charter  of the United Nations.  
1947_113	1947_113	World economic cooperation is essential to world political cooperation. We  have made a good start on economic cooperation through the International  Bank, the International Monetary fund, and the Export_Import Bank. We must  now take other steps for the reconstruction of world trade and we should  continue to strive for an international trade system as free from  obstructions as possible.  
1947_114	1947_114	ATOMIC ENERGY  
1947_123	1947_123	The Navy is supporting the occupation troops in Europe and in the Far East.  Its fundamental mission to support our national interests wherever  required is unchanged. The Navy, including the Marine Corps, will average  571,000 officers and men during the fiscal year 1948.  
1947_128	1947_128	National security does not consist only of an army, a navy, and an air  force. It rests on a much broader basis. It depends on a sound economy of  prices and wages, on prosperous agriculture, on satisfied and productive  workers, on a competitive private enterprise free from monopolistic  repression, on continued industrial harmony and production, on civil  liberties and human freedoms_on all the forces which create in our men and  women a strong moral fiber and spiritual stamina.  
1948_1	1948_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, and Members of the 80th Congress:  
1948_3	1948_3	On this occasion, above all others, the Congress and the President should  concentrate their attention, not upon party but upon the country; not upon  things which divide us but upon those which bind us together the enduring  principles of our American system, and our common aspirations for the  future welfare and security of the people of the United States.  
1948_11	1948_11	We must devote ourselves to finding answers to these anxieties and  aspirations. We seek answers which will embody the moral and spiritual  elements of tolerance, unselfishness, and brotherhood upon which true  freedom and opportunity must rest.  
1948_13	1948_13	It was 10 years ago that the determination of dictators to wage war upon  mankind became apparent. The years that followed brought untold death and  destruction.  
1948_14	1948_14	We shared in the human suffering of the war, but we were fortunate enough  to escape most of war's destruction. We were able through these 10 years to  expand the productive strength of our farms and factories.  
1948_18	1948_18	I propose that we look ahead today toward those goals for the future which  have the greatest bearing upon the foundations of our democracy and the  happiness of our people.  
1948_21	1948_21	The United States has always had a deep concern for human rights. Religious  freedom, free speech, and freedom of thought are cherished realities in our  land. Any denial of human rights is a denial of the basic beliefs of  democracy and of our regard for the worth of each individual.  
1948_24	1948_24	We should also consider our obligation to assure the fullest possible  measure of civil rights to the people of our territories and possessions. I  believe that the time has come for Alaska and Hawaii to be admitted to the  Union as States.  
1948_28	1948_28	We should now extend unemployment compensation, old age benefits, and  survivors' benefits to millions who are not now protected. We should also  raise the level of benefits.  
1948_33	1948_33	Our educational systems face a financial crisis. It is deplorable that in a  Nation as rich as ours there are millions of children who do not have  adequate schoolhouses or enough teachers for a good elementary or secondary  education. If there are educational inadequacies in any State, the whole  Nation suffers. The Federal Government has a responsibility for providing  financial aid to meet this crisis.  
1948_36	1948_36	Health and education have their beginning in the home. No matter what our  hospitals or schools are like, the youth of our Nation are handicapped when  millions of them live in city slums and country shacks. Within the next  decade, we must see that every American family has a decent home. As an  immediate step we need the long_range housing program which I have  recommended on many occasions to this Congress. This should include  financial aids designed to yield more housing at lower prices. It should  provide public housing for low_income families, and vigorous development of  new techniques to lower the cost of building.  
1948_38	1948_38	We have had, and shall continue to have, a special interest in the welfare  of our veterans. Over 14 million men and women who served in the armed  forces in World War II have now returned to civilian life. Over 2 million  veterans are being helped through school. Millions have been aided while  finding jobs, and have been helped in buying homes, in obtaining medical  care, and in adjusting themselves to physical handicaps.  
1948_39	1948_39	All but a very few veterans have successfully made the transition from  military life to their home communities. The success of our veterans'  program is proved by this fact. This Nation is proud of the eagerness shown  by our veterans to become self_reliant and self_supporting citizens.  
1948_41	1948_41	The resources given by nature to this country are rich and extensive. The  material foundations of our growth and economic development are the bounty  of our fields, the wealth of our mines and forests, and the energy of our  waters. As a Nation, we are coming to appreciate more each day the dose  relationship between the conservation of these resources and the  preservation of our national strength.  
1948_42	1948_42	We are doing far less than we know how to do to make use of our resources  without destroying them. Both the public and private use of these resources  must have the primary objective of maintaining and increasing these basic  supports for an expanding future.  
1948_50	1948_50	Our fourth goal is to lift the standard of living for all our people by  strengthening our economic system and sharing more broadly among our people  the goods we produce.  
1948_51	1948_51	The amazing economic progress of the past 10 years points the way for the  next 10.  
1948_53	1948_53	Our yearly output of goods and services has increased by two_thirds.  
1948_54	1948_54	The average income of our people, measured in dollars of equal purchasing  power, has increased after taxes by more than 50 percent.  
1948_58	1948_58	To do this, agriculture, business, and labor must move forward together.  
1948_61	1948_61	To this end our farm program should enable the farmer to market his varied  crops at fair price levels and to improve his standard of living.  
1948_62	1948_62	We need to continue price supports for major farm commodities on a basis  which will afford reasonable protection against fluctuations in the levels  of production and demand. The present price support program must be  reexamined and modernized.  
1948_64	1948_64	We also need to improve the means for getting farm products into markets  and into the hands of consumers. Cooperatives which [p.6] directly or  indirectly serve this purpose must be encouraged not discouraged. The  school lunch program should be continued and adequately financed.  
1948_67	1948_67	All these are practical measures upon which we should act immediately to  enable agriculture to make its full contribution to our prosperity.  
1948_68	1948_68	We must also strengthen our economic system within the next decade by  enlarging our industrial capacity within the framework of our free  enterprise system.  
1948_70	1948_70	Growth and vitality in our economy depend on vigorous private enterprise.  Free competition is the key to industrial development, full production and  employment, fair prices, and an ever improving standard of living.  Competition is seriously limited today in many industries by the  concentration of economic power and other elements of monopoly. The  appropriation of sufficient funds to permit proper enforcement of the  present antitrust laws is essential. Beyond that we should go on to  strengthen our legislation to protect competition.  
1948_74	1948_74	In general, however, we must continue to rely on our sound system of  collective bargaining to set wage scales. Workers' incomes should increase  at a rate consistent with the maintenance of sound price, profit, and wage  relationships and with increase of productivity.  
1948_83	1948_83	We have learned that a healthy world economy is essential to world  peace that economic distress is a disease whose evil effects spread far  beyond the boundaries of the afflicted nation.  
1948_86	1948_86	We believe that the United States can be an effective force for world peace  only if it is strong. We look forward to the day when nations will decrease  their armaments. Yet so long as there remains serious opposition to the  ideals of a peaceful world, we must maintain strong armed forces.  
1948_87	1948_87	The passage of the National Security Act by the Congress at its last  session was a notable step in providing for the security of this country. A  further step which I consider of even greater importance is the early  provision for universal training. There are many elements in a balanced  national security program, all interrelated and necessary, but universal  training should be the foundation for them all. A favorable decision by the  Congress at an early date is of world importance. I am convinced that such  action is vital to the security of this Nation and to the maintenance of  its leadership.  
1948_88	1948_88	The United States is engaged today in many international activities  directed toward the creation of lasting peaceful relationships among  nations.  
1948_89	1948_89	We have been giving substantial aid to Greece and Turkey to assist those  nations in preserving their integrity against foreign pressures. Had it not  been for our aid, their situation today might well be radically different.  The continued integrity of those countries will have a powerful effect upon  other nations in the Middle East and in Europe struggling to maintain their  independence while they repair the damages of war.  
1948_92	1948_92	We are moving toward our goal of world peace in many ways. But the most  important efforts which we are now making are those which support world  economic reconstruction. We are seeking to restore the world trading system  which was shattered by the war and to remedy the economic paralysis which  grips many countries.  
1948_94	1948_94	Our present major effort toward economic reconstruction is to support the  program for recovery developed by the countries of Europe. In my recent  message to the Congress, I outlined the reasons why it is wise and  necessary for the United States to extend this support.  
1948_96	1948_96	We intend to work also with other nations in achieving world economic  recovery. We shall continue our cooperation with the nations of the Western  Hemisphere. A special program of assistance to China, to provide urgent  relief needs and to speed reconstruction, will be submitted to the  Congress.  
1948_100	1948_100	We are following a sound, constructive, and practical course in carrying  out our determination to achieve peace.  
1948_101	1948_101	We are fighting poverty, hunger, and suffering.  
1948_102	1948_102	This leads to peace not war.  
1948_109	1948_109	Worst of all, inflation holds the threat of another depression, just as we  had a depression after the unstable boom following the First World War.  
1948_112	1948_112	The events which have occurred since I presented my 10_point anti_inflation  program to the Congress in November have made it even clearer that all 10  points are essential.  
1948_113	1948_113	High prices must not be our means of rationing.  
1948_118	1948_118	Government expenditures have been and must continue to be held at the  lowest safe levels. Since V_J day Federal expenditures have been sharply  reduced. They have been cut from more than $63 billion in the fiscal year  1946 to less than $38 billion in the present fiscal year. The number of  civilian employees has been cut nearly in half from 3 3/4 million down to  2 million.  
1948_120	1948_120	Certain adjustments should be made within our existing tax structure that  will not affect total receipts, yet will adjust the tax burden so that  those least able to pay will have their burden lessened by the transfer of  a portion of it to those best able to pay.  
1948_122	1948_122	Because of this extraordinarily high level of profits, corporations can  well afford to carry a larger share of the taxload at this time.  
1949_17	1949_17	Our production is still not large enough to satisfy our demands.  
1949_18	1949_18	Our minimum wages are far too low.  
1949_20	1949_20	Our farmers still face an uncertain future. And too many of them lack the  benefits of our modern civilization.  
1949_29	1949_29	This objective cannot be attained by government alone. Indeed, the greater  part of the task must be performed by individual efforts under our system  of free enterprise. We can keep our present prosperity, and increase it,  only if free enterprise and free government work together to that end.  
1949_30	1949_30	We cannot afford to float along ceaselessly on a postwar boom until it  collapses. It is not enough merely to prepare to weather a recession if it  comes. Instead, government and business must work together constantly to  achieve more and more jobs and more and more production which mean more  and more prosperity for all the people.  
1949_31	1949_31	The business cycle is man_made; and men of good will, working together, can  smooth it out.  
1949_36	1949_36	Second, to grant authority to regulate speculation on the commodity  exchanges.  
1949_38	1949_38	Fourth, to continue the priorities and allocation authority in the field of  transportation.  
1949_43	1949_43	The Economic Report, which I shall submit to the Congress shortly, will  discuss in detail the economic background for these recommendations.  
1949_50	1949_50	If our free enterprise economy is to be strong and healthy, we must  reinvigorate the forces of competition. We must assure small business the  freedom and opportunity to grow and prosper. To this purpose, we should  strengthen our antitrust laws by closing those loopholes that permit  monopolistic mergers and consolidations.  
1949_56	1949_56	We must push forward the development of our rivers for power, irrigation,  navigation, and flood control. We should apply the lessons of our Tennessee  Valley experience to our other great river basins.  
1949_60	1949_60	The Government has still other opportunities to help raise the standard of  living of our citizens. These opportunities lie in the fields of social  security, health, education, housing, and civil rights.  
1949_61	1949_61	The present coverage of the social security laws is altogether inadequate;  the benefit payments are too low. One_third of our workers are not covered.  Those who receive old_age and survivors insurance benefits receive an  average payment of only $25 a month. Many others who cannot work because  they are physically disabled are left to the mercy of charity. We should  expand our social security program, both as to the size of the benefits and  the extent of coverage, against the economic hazards due to unemployment,  old age, sickness, and disability.  
1949_65	1949_65	The housing shortage continues to be acute. As an immediate step, the  Congress should enact the provisions for low_rent public housing, slum  clearance, farm housing, and housing research which I have repeatedly  recommended. The number of low_rent public housing units provided for in the  legislation should be increased to 1 million units in the next 7 years.  Even this number of units will not begin to meet our need for new housing.  
1949_68	1949_68	The authority which I have requested, to allocate materials in short supply  and to impose price ceilings on such materials, could be used, if found  necessary, to channel more materials into homes large enough for family  life at prices which wage earners can afford.  
1949_69	1949_69	The driving force behind our progress is our faith in our democratic  institutions. That faith is embodied in the promise of equal rights and  equal opportunities which the founders of our Republic proclaimed to their  countrymen and to the whole world.  
1949_74	1949_74	The heart of our foreign policy is peace. We are supporting a world  organization to keep peace and a world economic policy to create prosperity  for mankind. Our guiding star is the principle of international  cooperation. To this concept we have made a national commitment as profound  as anything in history.  
1949_77	1949_77	During the course of this session I shall have occasion to ask the Congress  to consider several measures in the field of foreign policy. At this time,  I recommend that we restore the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act to full  effectiveness, and extend it for 3 years. We should also open our doors to  displaced persons without unfair discrimination.  
1949_79	1949_79	We believe that if we hold resolutely to this course, the principle of  international cooperation will eventually command the approval even of  those nations which are now seeking to weaken or subvert it.  
1949_82	1949_82	This is the task before us.  
1949_84	1949_84	I hope for cooperation from farmers, from labor, and from business. Every  segment of our population and every individual has a right to expect from  our Government a fair deal.  
1949_87	1949_87	The people of this great country have a right to expect that the Congress  and the President will work in closest cooperation with one objective the  welfare of the people of this Nation as a whole.  
1949_89	1949_89	Now, I am confident that the Divine Power which has guided us to this time  of fateful responsibility and glorious opportunity will not desert us now.  
1950_2	1950_2	A year ago I reported to this Congress that the state of the Union was  good. I am happy to be able to report to you today that the state of the  Union continues to be good. Our Republic continues to increase in the  enjoyment of freedom within its borders, and to offer strength and  encouragement to all those who love freedom throughout the world.  
1950_6	1950_6	In our domestic affairs, we have made notable advances toward broader  opportunity and a better life for all our citizens.  
1950_9	1950_9	Today, by the grace of God, we stand a free and prosperous nation with  greater possibilities for the future than any people ever had before in the  history of the world.  
1950_15	1950_15	Among all the great changes that have occurred in the last 50 years, none  is more important than the change in the position of the United States in  world affairs. Fifty years ago we were a country devoted largely to our own  internal affairs. Our industry was growing, and we had new interests in the  Far East and in the Caribbean, but we were primarily concerned with the  development of vast areas of our own continental territory.  
1950_19	1950_19	Right here, I want to say that no one appreciates more than I the  bipartisan cooperation in foreign affairs which has been enjoyed by this  administration.  
1950_20	1950_20	Our success in working with other nations to achieve peace depends largely  on what we do at home. We must preserve our national strength. Strength is  not simply a matter of arms and force. It is a matter of economic growth,  and social health, and vigorous institutions, public and private. We can  achieve peace only if we maintain our productive energy, our democratic  institutions, and our firm belief in individual freedom.  
1950_22	1950_22	This country of ours has experienced many blessings, but none greater than  its dedication to these principles. At every point in our history, these  ideals have served to correct our failures and shortcomings, to spur us on  to greater efforts, and to keep clearly before us the primary purpose of  our existence as a nation. They have enshrined for us, a principle of  government, the moral imperative to do justice, and the divine command to  men to love one another.  
1950_23	1950_23	These principles give meaning to all that we do.  
1950_24	1950_24	In foreign policy, they mean that we can never be tolerant of oppression or  tyranny. They mean that we must throw our weight on the side of greater  freedom and a better life for all peoples. These principles confirm us in  carrying out the specific programs for peace which we have already begun.  
1950_31	1950_31	World prosperity also requires that we do all we can to expand world trade.  As a major step in this direction we should promptly join the International  Trade Organization. The purpose of this organization, which the United  States has been foremost in creating, is to establish a code of fair  practice, and an international authority for adjusting differences in  international commercial relations. It is an effort to prevent the kind of  anarchy and irresponsibility in world trade which did so much to bring  about the world depression of the 1930's. An expanding world economy  requires the improvement of living standards and the development of  resources in areas where human poverty and misery now prevail. Without such  improvement the recovery of Europe and the future of our own economy will  not be secure. I urge that the Congress adopt the legislation now before it  to provide for increasing the flow of technical assistance and capital  investment in underdeveloped regions.  
1950_32	1950_32	It is more essential now than ever, if the ideals of freedom and  representative government are to prevail in these areas, and particularly  in the Far East, that their peoples experience, in their own lives, the  benefits of scientific and economic advances. This program will require the  movement of large amounts of capital from the industrial nations, and  particularly from the United States, to productive uses in the  underdeveloped areas of the world. Recent world events make prompt action  imperative.  
1950_35	1950_35	In the world today we are confronted with the danger that the rising demand  of people everywhere for freedom and a better life may be corrupted and  betrayed by the false promises of communism. In its ruthless struggle for  power, communism seizes upon our imperfections, and takes advantage of the  delays and setbacks which the democratic nations experience in their effort  to secure a better life for their citizens. This challenge to us is more  than a military challenge. It is a challenge to the honesty of our  profession of the democratic faith; it is a challenge to the efficiency and  stability of our economic system; it is a challenge to the willingness to  work with other peoples for world peace and for world prosperity.  
1950_38	1950_38	The ideal of equal opportunity no longer means simply the opportunity which  a man has to advance beyond his fellows. Some of our citizens do achieve  greater success than others as a reward for individual merit and effort,  and this is as it should be. At the same time our country must be more than  a land of opportunity for a select few. It must be a land of opportunity  for all of us. In such a land we can grow and prosper together.  
1950_44	1950_44	No one, of course, can foretell the future exactly. However, if we assume  that we shall grow as fast in the future as we have grown in the past, we  can get a good idea of how much our country should grow in the next 50  years.  
1950_46	1950_46	These are estimates of what we can do in the future, but we can reach these  heights only if we follow the right policies. We have learned by bitter  experience that progress is not automatic that wrong policies lead to  depression and disaster. We cannot achieve these gains unless we have a  stable economy and avoid the catastrophes of boom and bust that have set us  back in the past.  
1950_50	1950_50	To avoid this danger, we must curb monopoly and provide aids to independent  business so that it may have the credit and capital to compete in a system  of free enterprise. I recommend that the Congress complete action at this  session on the pending bill to close the loopholes in the Clayton Act which  now permit monopolistic mergers. I also hope before this session is over to  transmit to the Congress a series of proposals to strengthen the  antimonopoly laws, to assist small business, and to encourage the growth of  new enterprises.  
1950_51	1950_51	In the case of labor, free collective bargaining must be protected and  encouraged. Collective bargaining is not only a fundamental economic  freedom for labor. It is also a strengthening and stabilizing influence for  our whole economy.  
1950_60	1950_60	If we are to achieve a better life for all, the natural resources of the  country must be regarded as a public trust. We must use our precious assets  of soil, water, and forest, and grassland in such a way that they become  constantly more productive and more valuable. Government investment in the  conservation and development of our resources is necessary to the future  economic expansion of the country.  
1950_61	1950_61	We need to enlarge the production and transmission of public power. That is  true not only in those regions which have already received great benefits  from Federal power projects, but also in regions such as New England where  the benefits of large_scale public power development have not yet been  experienced.  
1950_66	1950_66	To take full advantage of the increasing possibilities of nature we must  equip ourselves with increasing knowledge. Government has a responsibility  to see that our country maintains its position in the advance of science.  As a step toward this end, the Congress should complete action on the  measure to create a National Science Foundation.  
1950_67	1950_67	Another duty of the Government is to promote the economic security, the  health, and the education of its citizens. By so doing, we strengthen both  our economy and the structure of our society. In a nation as rich as ours,  all citizens should be able to live in decency and health.  
1950_70	1950_70	In the field of health there are immense opportunities to extend to more of  our people the benefits of the amazing advances in medical science. We have  made a good beginning in expanding our hospitals, but we must also go on to  remedy the shortages of doctors, nurses, and public health services, and to  establish a system of medical insurance which will enable all Americans to  afford good medical care.  
1950_71	1950_71	We must take immediate steps to strengthen our educational system. In many  parts of our country, young people are being handicapped for life because  of a poor education. The rapidly increasing number of children of school  age, coupled with the shortage of qualified teachers, makes this problem  more critical each year. I believe that the Congress should no longer delay  in providing Federal assistance to the States so that they can maintain  adequate schools.  
1950_72	1950_72	As we go forward in achieving greater economic security and greater  opportunity for all our people, we should make every effort to extend the  benefits of our democratic institutions to every citizen. The religious  ideals which we profess, and the heritage of freedom which we have received  from the past, clearly place that duty upon us. I again urge the Congress  to enact the civil rights proposals I made in February 1948. These  proposals are for the enactment of Federal statutes which will protect all  our people in the exercise of their democratic rights and their search for  economic opportunity, grant statehood to Alaska and Hawaii, provide a  greater measure of self_government for our island possessions, and accord  home rule to the District of Columbia. Some of those proposals have been  before the Congress for a long time. Those who oppose them, as well as  those who favor them, should recognize that it is the duty of the elected  representatives of the people to let these proposals come to a vote.  
1950_74	1950_74	The measures I am recommending to the Congress concerning both our foreign  and our domestic policies represent a carefully considered program to meet  our national needs. It is a program which necessarily requires large  expenditures of funds. More than 70 percent of the Government's  expenditures are required to meet the costs of past wars and to work for  world peace. This is the dominant factor in our fiscal policy. At the same  time, the Government must make substantial expenditures which are necessary  to the growth and expansion of the domestic economy.  
1950_79	1950_79	The fiscal policy I am recommending is the quickest and safest way of  achieving a balanced budget.  
1950_81	1950_81	We work for a better life for all, so that all men may put to good use the  great gifts with which they have been endowed by their Creator. We seek to  establish those material conditions of life in which, without exception,  men may live in dignity, perform useful work, serve their communities, and  worship God as they see fit.  
1950_82	1950_82	These may seem simple goals, but they are not little ones. They are worth a  great deal more than all the empires and conquests of history. They are not  to be achieved by military aggression or political fanaticism. They are to  be achieved by humbler means_by hard work, by a spirit of self_restraint in  our dealings with one another, and by a deep devotion to the principles of  justice and equality.  
1951_4	1951_4	I know that the 82d Congress will meet this challenge in a way worthy of  our great heritage. I know that your debates will be earnest, responsible,  constructive, and to the point. I know that from these debates there will  come the great decisions needed to carry us forward.  
1951_7	1951_7	We will succeed, but we must all do our part. We must all act together as  citizens of this great Republic.  
1951_14	1951_14	The free nations do not have any aggressive purpose. We want only peace in  the world peace for all countries. No threat to the security of any nation  is concealed in our plans and programs.  
1951_17	1951_17	This new imperialism has powerful military forces. It is keeping millions  of men under arms. It has a large air force and a strong submarine force.  It has complete control of the men and equipment of its satellites. It has  kept its subject peoples and its economy in a state of perpetual  mobilization.  
1951_19	1951_19	The Soviet imperialists have two ways of going about their destructive  work. They use the method of subversion and internal revolution, and they  use the method of external aggression. In preparation for either of these  methods of attack, they stir up class strife and disorder. They encourage  sabotage. They put out poisonous propaganda. They deliberately try to  prevent economic improvement.  
1951_23	1951_23	The free nations believe in the dignity and the worth of man.  
1951_24	1951_24	We believe in independence for all nations.  
1951_29	1951_29	Our own national security is deeply involved with that of the other free  nations. While they need our support, we equally need theirs. Our national  safety would be gravely prejudiced if the Soviet Union were to succeed in  harnessing to its war machine the resources and the manpower of the free  nations on the borders of its empire.  
1951_31	1951_31	In such a situation, the Soviet Union could impose its demands on the  world, without resort to conflict, simply through the preponderance of its  economic and military power. The Soviet Union does not have to attack the  United States to secure domination of the world. It can achieve its ends by  isolating us and swallowing up all our allies. Therefore, even if we were  craven enough I do not believe we could be but, I say, even if we were  craven enough to abandon our ideals, it would be disastrous for us to  withdraw from the community of free nations.  
1951_32	1951_32	We are the most powerful single member of this community, and we have a  special responsibility. We must take the leadership in meeting the  challenge to freedom and in helping to protect the rights of independent  nations.  
1951_45	1951_45	To put these plans into action, we sent to Europe last week one of our  greatest military commanders, General Dwight D. Eisenhower.  
1951_51	1951_51	It is in the Far East that we have taken up arms, under the United Nations,  to preserve the principle of independence for free nations. We are fighting  to keep the forces of Communist aggression from making a slave state out of  Korea.  
1951_52	1951_52	Korea has tremendous significance for the world. It means that free  nations, acting through the United Nations, are fighting together against  aggression.  
1951_57	1951_57	The Soviet rulers have made it clear that we must have strength as well as  right on our side. If we build our strength and we are building it the  Soviet rulers may face the facts and lay aside their plans to take over the  world.  
1951_58	1951_58	That is what we hope will happen, and that is what we are trying to bring  about. That is the only realistic road to peace.  
1951_64	1951_64	In many cases, however, our stocks of weapons are low. In other cases,  those on hand are not the most modern. We have made remarkable technical  advances. We have developed new types of jet planes and powerful new tanks.  We are concentrating on producing the newest types of weapons and producing  them as fast as we can.  
1951_65	1951_65	This production drive is more selective than the one we had during World  War II, but it is just as urgent and intense. It is a big program and it is  a costly one.  
1951_66	1951_66	Let me give you two concrete examples. Our present program calls for  expanding the aircraft industry so that it will have the capacity to  produce 50,000 modern military planes a year. We are preparing the capacity  to produce 35,000 tanks a year. We are not now ordering that many planes or  that many tanks, and we hope that we never have to, but we mean to be able  to turn them out if we need them.  
1951_71	1951_71	The first part is to get our defense production going as fast as possible.  We have to convert plants and channel materials to defense production. This  means heavy cuts in civilian uses of copper, aluminum, rubber, and other  essential materials. It means shortages in various consumer goods.  
1951_74	1951_74	The Congress will need to consider legislation, at this session, affecting  all the aspects of our mobilization job. The main subjects on which  legislation will be needed are:  
1951_75	1951_75	First, appropriations for our military buildup.  
1951_81	1951_81	Seventh, housing and training of defense workers and the full use of all  our manpower resources.  
1951_83	1951_83	Ninth, aid to the States to meet the most urgent needs of our elementary  and secondary schools. Some of our plans will have to be deferred for the  time being. But we should do all we can to make sure our children are being  trained as good and useful citizens in the critical times ahead.  
1951_92	1951_92	We are building up our strength, in concert with other free nations, to  meet the danger of aggression that has been turned loose on the world. The  strength of the free nations is the world's best hope of peace.  
1951_94	1951_94	Make no mistake about my meaning. I do not ask, or expect, unanimity. I do  not ask for an end to debate. Only by debate can we arrive at decisions  which are wise, and which reflect the desires of the American people. We do  not have a dictatorship in this country, and we never will have one in this  country.  
1951_96	1951_96	Let us keep our eyes on the issues and work for the things we all believe  in.  
1951_97	1951_97	Let each of us put our country ahead of our party, and ahead of our own  personal interests.  
1951_99	1951_99	Let us all stand together as Americans. Let us stand together with all men  everywhere who believe in human liberty.  
1951_102	1951_102	This is our cause peace, freedom, justice. We will pursue this cause with  determination and humility, asking divine guidance that in all we do we may  follow the will of God.  
1952_2	1952_2	I have the honor to report to the Congress on the state of the Union.  
1952_13	1952_13	Peace depends upon the free nations sticking together, and making a  combined effort to check aggression and prevent war. In this respect, 1951  was a year of great achievement.  
1952_15	1952_15	In Indochina and Malaya, our aid has helped our allies to hold back the  Communist advance, although there are signs of further trouble in that  area.  
1952_16	1952_16	In 1951 we strengthened the chances of peace in the Pacific region by the  treaties with Japan and the defense arrangements with Australia, New  Zealand, and the Philippines.  
1952_17	1952_17	In Europe combined defense has become a reality. The free nations have  created a real fighting force. This force is not yet as strong as it needs  to be; but it is already a real obstacle to any attempt by hostile forces  to sweep across Europe to the Atlantic.  
1952_20	1952_20	At the present session of the United Nations in Paris, we, together with  the British and the French, offered a plan to reduce and control all  armaments under a foolproof inspection system. This is a concrete,  practical proposal for disarmament.  
1952_27	1952_27	This expansion will mean more jobs and higher standards of living for all  of us in the years ahead. At the present time it means greater strength for  us and for the rest of the free world in the fight for peace.  
1952_29	1952_29	The outstanding fact to note on the debit side of the ledger is that the  Soviet Union, in 1951, continued to expand its military production and  increase its already excessive military power.  
1952_30	1952_30	It is true that the Soviets have run into increasing difficulties. Their  hostile policies have awakened stern resistance among free men throughout  the world. And behind the Iron Curtain the Soviet rule of force has created  growing political and economic stresses in the satellite nations.  
1952_32	1952_32	And here at home, our defense preparations are far from complete.  
1952_36	1952_36	In the Middle East political tensions and the oil controversy in Iran are  keeping the region in a turmoil. In the Far East the dark threat of  Communist imperialism still hangs over many nations.  
1952_37	1952_37	This, very briefly, is the good side and the bad side of the picture.  
1952_40	1952_40	Our task will not be easy; but if we go at it with a will, we can look  forward to steady progress. On our side are all the great resources of  freedom the ideals of religion and democracy, the aspiration of people for  a better life, and the industrial and technical power of a free  civilization.  
1952_43	1952_43	But if there are any among us who think we ought to ease up in the fight  for peace, I want to remind them of three things just three things.  
1952_47	1952_47	This is a time for courage, not for grumbling and mumbling.  
1952_49	1952_49	The thing that is uppermost in the minds of all of us is the situation in  Korea. We must, and we will, keep up the fight there until we get the kind  of armistice that will put an end to the aggression and protect the safety  of our forces and the security of the Republic of Korea. Beyond that we  shall continue to work for a settlement in Korea that upholds the  principles of the United Nations.  
1952_51	1952_51	Meanwhile, we must continue to strengthen the forces of freedom throughout  the world.  
1952_56	1952_56	In the long run we want to see Europe freed from any dependence on our aid.  Our European allies want that just as bad as we do. The steps that are now  being taken to build European unity should help bring that about. Six  European countries are pooling their coal and steel production under the  Schuman plan. Work is going forward on the merger of European national  forces on the Continent into a single army. These great projects should  become realities in 1952.  
1952_58	1952_58	In Asia the new Communist empire is a daily threat to millions of people.  The peoples of Asia want to be free to follow their own way of life. They  want to preserve their culture and their traditions against communism, just  as much as we want to preserve ours. They are laboring under terrific  handicaps poverty, ill health, feudal systems of land ownership, and the  threat of internal subversion or external attack. We can and we must  increase our help to them.  
1952_61	1952_61	This last year we made available millions of bushels of wheat to relieve  famine in India. But far more important, in the long run, is the work  Americans are doing in India to help the Indian farmers themselves raise  more grain. With the help of our technicians, Indian farmers, using simple,  inexpensive means, have been able since 1948 to double the crops in one  area in India. One farmer there raised 63 bushels of wheat to the acre,  where 13 bushels had been the average before.  
1952_63	1952_63	My friends of the Congress, less than one_third of the expenditure for the  cost of World War II would have created the developments necessary to feed  the whole world so we wouldn't have to stomach communism. That is what we  have got to fight, and unless we fight that battle and win it, we can't win  the cold war or a hot one either.  
1952_74	1952_74	The very critical part of our defense job this year is to keep down  inflation.  
1952_77	1952_77	Congress has a tremendous responsibility in this matter. Our stabilization  law was shot full of holes at the last session. This year, it will be one  of the main tasks before the Congress to repair the damage and enact a  strong anti_inflation law.  
1952_81	1952_81	Our strength depends upon the health, the morale, the freedom of our  people. We can take on the burden of leadership in the fight for world  peace because, for nearly 20 years, the Government and the people have been  working together for the general welfare. We have given more and more of  out citizens a fair chance at decent, useful, productive lives. That is the  reason we are as strong as we are today.  
1952_82	1952_82	This Government of ours the Congress and the executive both must keep on  working to bring about a fair deal for all the American people. Some people  will say that we haven't the time or the money this year for measures for  the welfare of the people. But if we want to win the fight for peace, this  is a part of the job we cannot ignore.  
1952_84	1952_84	I believe most people in this country will agree with me on that.  
1952_87	1952_87	I think our businessmen know that scientific research and transportation  services and more steel mills and power projects are not luxuries, but  necessities to keep our business and our industry in the forefront of  industrial progress.  
1952_98	1952_98	We should also make some cost_of_living adjustments for those receiving  veterans' compensation for death or disability incurred in the service of  our country. In addition, now is the time to start a sensible program of  readjustment benefits for our veterans who have seen service since the  fighting broke out in Korea.  
1952_104	1952_104	All these measures I have been talking about measures to advance the  well_being of our people demonstrate to the world the forward movement of  our free society.  
1952_109	1952_109	I have already made some recommendations to the Congress to help accomplish  these purposes. I intend to submit further recommendations to this end. I  will welcome the wholehearted cooperation of the Congress in this effort.  
1952_112	1952_112	When you come right down to it, it is the courage and the character of our  Nation and of each one of us as individuals_that will really decide how  well we meet this challenge.  
1952_117	1952_117	We must have that same faith and vision. In the great contest in which we  are engaged today, we cannot expect to have fair weather all the way. But  it is a contest just as important for this country and for all men, as the  desperate struggle that George Washington fought through to victory.  
1953_1	1953_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Eighty_third Congress:  
1953_8	1953_8	The purpose of this message is to suggest certain lines along which our  joint efforts may immediately be directed toward realization of these four  ruling purposes.  
1953_13	1953_13	This administration has, therefore, begun the definition of a new, positive  foreign policy. This policy will be governed by certain fixed ideas. They  are these:  
1953_14	1953_14	(1) Our foreign policy must be clear, consistent, and confident. This means  that it must be the product of genuine, continuous cooperation between the  executive and the legislative branches of this Government. It must be  developed and directed in the spirit of true bipartisanship.  
1953_16	1953_16	(3) Our policy, dedicated to making the free world secure, will envision  all peaceful methods and devices except breaking faith with our friends.  We shall never acquiesce in the enslavement of any people in order to  purchase fancied gain for ourselves. I shall ask the Congress at a later  date to join in an appropriate resolution making clear that this Government  recognizes no kind of commitment contained in secret understandings of the  past with foreign governments which permit this kind of enslavement.  
1953_18	1953_18	(5) Our policy will be designed to foster the advent of practical unity in  Western Europe. The nations of that region have contributed notably to the  effort of sustaining the security of the free world. From the jungles of  Indochina and Malaya to the northern shores of Europe, they have vastly  improved their defensive strength. Where called upon to do so, they have  made costly and bitter sacrifices to hold the line of freedom.  
1953_19	1953_19	But the problem of security demands closer cooperation among the nations of  Europe than has been known to date. Only a more closely integrated economic  and political system can provide the greatly increased economic strength  needed to maintain both necessary military readiness and respectable living  standards.  
1953_22	1953_22	(6) Our foreign policy will recognize the importance of profitable and  equitable world trade.  
1953_23	1953_23	A substantial beginning can and should be made by our friends themselves.  Europe, for example, is now marked by checkered areas of labor surplus and  labor shortage, of agricultural areas needing machines and industrial areas  needing food. Here and elsewhere we can hope that our friends will take the  initiative in creating broader markets and more dependable currencies, to  allow greater exchange of goods and services among themselves.  
1953_25	1953_25	This help includes:  
1953_26	1953_26	First: Revising our customs regulations to remove procedural obstacles to  profitable trade. I further recommend that the Congress take the Reciprocal  Trade Agreements Act under immediate study and extend it by appropriate  legislation. This objective must not ignore legitimate safeguarding of  domestic industries, agriculture, and labor standards. In all executive  study and recommendations on this problem labor and management and farmers  alike will be earnestly consulted.  
1953_35	1953_35	This has meant, in effect, that the United States Navy was required to  serve as a defensive arm of Communist China. Regardless of the situation in  1950, since the date of that order the Chinese Communists have invaded  Korea to attack the United Nations forces there. They have consistently  rejected the proposals of the United Nations Command for an armistice. They  recently joined with Soviet Russia in rejecting the armistice proposal  sponsored in the United Nations by the Government of India. This proposal  had been accepted by the United States and 53 other nations.  
1953_37	1953_37	I am, therefore, issuing instructions that the Seventh Fleet no longer be  employed to shield Communist China. This order implies no aggressive intent  on our part. But we certainly have no obligation to protect a nation  fighting us in Korea.  
1953_43	1953_43	We must realize clearly that size alone is not sufficient. The biggest  force is not necessarily the best and we want the best.  
1953_46	1953_46	Because of the complex technical nature of our military organization and  because of the security reasons involved, the Secretary of Defense must  take the initiative and assume the responsibility for developing plans to  give our Nation maximum safety at minimum cost. Accordingly, the new  Secretary of Defense and his civilian and military associates will, in the  future, recommend such changes in present laws affecting our defense  activities as may be necessary to clarify responsibilities and improve the  total effectiveness of our defense effort.  
1953_54	1953_54	Civil defense responsibilities primarily belong to the State and local  governments recruiting, training, and organizing volunteers to meet any  emergency. The immediate job of the Federal Government is to provide  leadership, to supply technical guidance, and to continue to strengthen its  civil defense stockpile of medical, engineering, and related supplies and  equipment. This work must go forward without lag.  
1953_55	1953_55	V.  
1953_57	1953_57	Our immediate task is to chart a fiscal and economic policy that can:  
1953_58	1953_58	(1) Reduce the planned deficits and then balance the budget, which means,  among other things, reducing Federal expenditures to the safe minimum;  
1953_61	1953_61	(4) Check the menace of inflation;  
1953_64	1953_64	It is important that all of us understand that this administration does not  and cannot begin its task with a clean slate. Much already has been written  on the record, beyond our power quickly to erase or to amend. This record  includes our inherited burden of indebtedness and obligations and  deficits.  
1953_74	1953_74	Reduction of taxes will be justified only as we show we can succeed in  bringing the budget under control. As the budget is balanced and inflation  checked, the tax burden that today stifles initiative can and must be  eased.  
1953_84	1953_84	We are, of course, living in an international situation that is neither an  emergency demanding full mobilization, nor is it peace. No one can know how  long this condition will persist. Consequently, we are forced to learn many  new things as we go along_clinging to what works, discarding what does  not.  
1953_88	1953_88	I recommend the continuance of the authority for Federal control over rents  in those communities in which serious housing shortages exist. These are  chiefly the so_called defense areas. In these and all areas the Federal  Government should withdraw from the control of rents as soon as  practicable. But before they are removed entirely, each legislature should  have full opportunity to take over, within its own State, responsibility  for this function.  
1953_89	1953_89	It would be idle to pretend that all our problems in this whole field of  prices will solve themselves by mere Federal withdrawal from direct  controls.  
1953_92	1953_92	VI.  
1953_94	1953_94	The safety of America and the trust of the people alike demand that the  personnel of the Federal Government be loyal in their motives and reliable  in the discharge of their duties. Only a combination of both loyalty and  reliability promises genuine security.  
1953_97	1953_97	I am determined to meet this responsibility of the Executive. The heads of  all executive departments and agencies have been instructed to initiate at  once effective programs of security with respect to their personnel. The  Attorney General will advise and guide the departments and agencies in the  shaping of these programs, designed at once to govern the employment of new  personnel and to review speedily any derogatory information concerning  incumbent personnel.  
1953_100	1953_100	All these measures have two clear purposes: Their first purpose is to make  certain that this Nation's security is not jeopardized by false servants.  Their second purpose is to clear the atmosphere of that unreasoned  suspicion that accepts rumor and gossip as substitutes for evidence.  
1953_102	1953_102	I have already established a Committee on Government Organization. The  Committee is using as its point of departure the reports of the Hoover  Commission and subsequent studies by several independent agencies. To  achieve the greater efficiency and economy which the Committee analyses  show to be possible, I ask the Congress to extend the present Government  Reorganization Act for a period of 18 months or 2 years beyond its  expiration date of April 1, 1953.  
1953_105	1953_105	In all departments, dedication to these basic precepts of security and  efficiency, integrity, and economy can and will produce an administration  deserving of the trust the people have placed in it.  
1953_108	1953_108	Vitally important are the water and minerals, public lands and standing  timber, forage and wild_life of this country. A fast_growing population will  have vast future needs in these resources. We must more than match the  substantial achievements in the half_century since President Theodore  Roosevelt awakened the Nation to the problem of conservation.  
1953_110	1953_110	The best natural resources program for America will not result from  exclusive dependence on Federal bureaucracy. It will involve a partnership  of the States and local communities, private citizens, and the Federal  Government, all working together. This combined effort will advance the  development of the great river valleys of our Nation and the power that  they can generate. Likewise, such a partnership can be effective in the  expansion throughout the Nation of upstream storage; the sound use of  public lands; the wise conservation of minerals; and the sustained yield of  our forests.  
1953_113	1953_113	VIII.  
1953_119	1953_119	The whole complex of agricultural programs and policies will be studied by  a Special Agricultural Advisory Commission, as I know it will by  appropriate committees of the Congress. A nonpartisan group of respected  authorities in the field of agriculture has already been appointed as an  interim advisory group.  
1953_121	1953_121	IX.  
1953_123	1953_123	The truth in matters of labor policy has become obscured in controversy.  The very meaning of economic freedom as it affects labor has become  confused. This misunderstanding has provided a climate of opinion favoring  the growth of governmental paternalism in labor relations. This tendency,  if left uncorrected, could end only by producing a bureaucratic despotism.  Economic freedom is, in fact, the requisite of greater prosperity for every  American who earns his own living.  
1953_124	1953_124	In the field of labor legislation, only a law that merits the respect and  support of both labor and management can help reduce the loss of wages and  of production through strikes and stoppages, and thus add to the total  economic strength of our Nation.  
1953_126	1953_126	I know that the Congress is already proceeding with renewed studies of this  subject. Meanwhile, the Department of Labor is at once beginning work to  devise further specific recommendations for your consideration.  
1953_127	1953_127	In the careful working out of legislation, I know you will give thoughtful  consideration as will we in the executive branch to the views of labor,  and of management, and of the general public. In this process, it is only  human that each of us should bring forward the arguments of self_interest.  But if all conduct their arguments in the overpowering light of national  interest which is enlightened self_interest we shall get the right  answers. I profoundly hope that every citizen of our country will follow  with understanding your progress in this work. The welfare of all of us is  involved.  
1953_129	1953_129	Government can do a great deal to aid the settlement of labor disputes  without allowing itself to be employed as an ally of either side. Its  proper role in industrial strife is to encourage the processes of mediation  and conciliation. These processes can successfully be directed only by a  government free from the taint of any suspicion that it is partial or  punitive.  
1953_131	1953_131	X.  
1953_132	1953_132	Our civil and social rights form a central part of the heritage we are  striving to defend on all fronts and with all our strength. I believe with  all my heart that our vigilant guarding of these rights is a sacred  obligation binding upon every citizen. To be true to one's own freedom is,  in essence, to honor and respect the freedom of all others.  
1953_133	1953_133	A cardinal ideal in this heritage we cherish is the equality of rights of  all citizens of every race and color and creed.  
1953_137	1953_137	I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President  to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal  Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces.  
1953_140	1953_140	There is one sphere in which civil rights are inevitably involved in  Federal legislation. This is the sphere of immigration.  
1953_141	1953_141	It is a manifest right of our Government to limit the number of immigrants  our Nation can absorb. It is also a manifest right of our Government to set  reasonable requirements on the character and the numbers of the people who  come to share our land and our freedom.  
1953_142	1953_142	It is well for us, however, to remind ourselves occasionally of an equally  manifest fact: we are one and all immigrants or sons and daughters of  immigrants.  
1953_144	1953_144	I am therefore requesting the Congress to review this legislation and to  enact a statute that will at one and the same time guard our legitimate  national interests and be faithful to our basic ideas of freedom and  fairness to all.  
1953_151	1953_151	Public interest similarly demands one prompt specific action in protection  of the general consumer. The Food and Drug Administration should be  authorized to continue its established and necessary program of factory  inspections. The invalidation of these inspections by the Supreme Court of  December 8, 1952, was based solely on the fact that the present law  contained inconsistent and unclear provisions. These must be promptly  corrected.  
1953_154	1953_154	I repeat that there are many important subjects of which I make no mention  today. Among these is our great and growing body of veterans. America has  traditionally been generous in caring for the disabled and the widow and  the orphan of the fallen. These millions remain close to all our hearts.  Proper care of our uniformed citizens and appreciation of the past service  of our veterans are part of our accepted governmental responsibilities.  
1953_161	1953_161	There is, in world affairs, a steady course to be followed between an  assertion of strength that is truculent and a confession of helplessness  that is cowardly.  
1953_162	1953_162	There is, in our affairs at home, a middle way between untrammeled freedom  of the individual and the demands for the welfare of the whole Nation. This  way must avoid government by bureaucracy as carefully as it avoids neglect  of the helpless.  
1953_164	1953_164	In this spirit must we live and labor: confident of our strength,  compassionate in our heart, clear in our mind.  
1953_165	1953_165	In this spirit, let us together turn to the great tasks before us.  
1954_3	1954_3	All branches of this Government and I venture to say both of our great  parties can support the general objective of the recommendations I make  today, for that objective is the building of a stronger America. A nation  whose every citizen has good reason for bold hope; where effort is rewarded  and prosperity is shared; where freedom expands and peace is secure that  is what I mean by a stronger America.  
1954_6	1954_6	First of all we are deeply grateful that our sons no longer die on the  distant mountains of Korea. Although they are still called from our homes  to military service, they are no longer called to the field of battle.  
1954_8	1954_8	Segregation in the armed forces and other Federal activities is on the way  out. We have also made progress toward its elimination in the District of  Columbia. These are steps in the continuing effort to eliminate  inter_racial difficulty.  
1954_9	1954_9	Some developments beyond our shores have been equally encouraging.  Communist aggression, halted in Korea, continues to meet in Indo_china the  vigorous resistance of France and the Associated States, assisted by timely  aid from our country. In West Germany, in Iran, and in other areas of the  world, heartening political victories have been won by the forces of  stability and freedom. Slowly but surely, the free world gathers strength.  Meanwhile, from behind the iron curtain, there are signs that tyranny is in  trouble and reminders that its structure is as brittle as its surface is  hard.  
1954_25	1954_25	The forthcoming Budget Message will propose maintenance of the Presidential  power of transferability of all assistance funds and will ask authority to  merge these funds with the regular defense funds. It will also propose that  the Secretary of Defense have primary responsibility for the administration  of foreign military assistance in accordance with the policy guidance of  the Secretary of State.  
1954_28	1954_28	ATOMIC ENERGY PROPOSAL  
1954_29	1954_29	As we maintain our military strength during the coming year and draw closer  the bonds with our allies, we shall be in an improved position to discuss  outstanding issues with the Soviet Union. Indeed we shall be glad to do so  whenever there is a reasonable prospect of constructive results. In this  spirit the atomic energy proposals of the United States were recently  presented to the United Nations General Assembly. A truly constructive  Soviet reaction will make possible a new start toward an era of peace, and  away from the fatal road toward atomic war.  
1954_31	1954_31	Since our hope is peace, we owe ourselves and the world a candid  explanation of the military measures we are taking to make that peace  secure.  
1954_35	1954_35	Second, the usefulness of these new weapons creates new relationships  between men and materials. These new relationships permit economies in the  use of men as we build forces suited to our situation in the world today.  As will be seen from the Budget Message on January 21, the airpower of our  Navy and Air Force is receiving heavy emphasis.  
1954_37	1954_37	Fourth, our defense must rest on trained manpower and its most economical  and mobile use. A professional corps is the heart of any security  organization. It is necessarily the teacher and leader of those who serve  temporarily in the discharge of the obligation to help defend the Republic.  Pay alone will not retain in the career service of our armed forces the  necessary numbers of long_term personnel. I strongly urge, therefore, a  more generous use of other benefits important to service morale. Among  these are more adequate living quarters and family housing units and  medical care for dependents.  
1954_40	1954_40	Another part of this foundation is, of course, our continental transport  system. Some of our vital heavy materials come increasingly from Canada.  Indeed our relations with Canada, happily always close, involve more and  more the unbreakable ties of strategic interdependence. Both nations now  need the St. Lawrence Seaway for security as well as for economic reasons.  I urge the Congress promptly to approve our participation in its  construction.  
1954_44	1954_44	The international and defense policies which I have outlined will enable us  to negotiate from a position of strength as we hold our resolute course  toward a peaceful world. We now turn to matters which are normally  characterized as domestic, well realizing that what we do abroad affects  every problem at home from the amount of taxes to our very state of mind.  
1954_51	1954_51	I turn now to the second great purpose of our government: Along with the  protection of freedom, the maintenance of a strong and growing economy.  
1954_52	1954_52	The American economy is one of the wonders of the world. It undergirds our  international position, our military security, and the standard of living  of every citizen. This Administration is determined to keep our economy  strong and to keep it growing.  
1954_55	1954_55	If new conditions arise that require additional administrative or  legislative action, the Administration will still be ready. A government  always ready, as this is, to take well_timed and vigorous action, and a  business community willing, as ours is, to plan boldly and with  confidence, can between them develop a climate assuring steady economic  growth.  
1954_61	1954_61	Third, by keeping new appropriation requests below estimated revenues, we  continue to reduce the tremendous accumulation of unfinanced obligations  incurred by the Government under past appropriations.  
1954_66	1954_66	Without attempting to summarize these manifold reforms, I can here  illustrate their tendency. For example, we propose more liberal tax  treatment for dependent children who work, for widows or widowers with  dependent children, and for medical expenses. For the business that wants  to expand or modernize its plant, we propose liberalized tax treatment of  depreciation, research and development expenses, and retained earnings.  
1954_71	1954_71	Agricultural laws now in effect successfully accomplished their wartime  purpose of encouraging maximum production of many crops. Today, production  of these crops at such levels far exceeds present demand. Yet the laws  encouraging such production are still in effect. The storage facilities of  the Commodity Credit Corporation bulge with surplus stocks of dairy  products, wheat, cotton, corn, and certain vegetable oils; and the  Corporation's presently authorized borrowing authority $6,750,000,000 is  nearly exhausted. Some products, priced out of domestic markets, and  others, priced out of world markets, have piled up in government hands. In  a world in which millions of people are hungry, destruction of food would,  of course, be unconscionable. Yet surplus stocks continue to threaten the  market and in spite of the acreage controls authorized by present law,  surpluses will continue to accumulate.  
1954_79	1954_79	All Federal conservation and resource development projects are being  reappraised. Sound projects now under way will be continued. New projects  in which the Federal Government has a part must be economically sound, with  local sharing of cost wherever appropriate and feasible. In the next fiscal  year work will be started on twenty_three projects that meet these  standards. The Federal Government will continue to construct and operate  economically sound flood control, power, irrigation and water supply  projects wherever these projects are beyond the capacity of local  initiative, public or private, and consistent with the needs of the whole  Nation.  
1954_82	1954_82	A uniform and consistent water resources policy;  
1954_84	1954_84	A sound program for safeguarding the domestic production of critical and  strategic metals and minerals.  
1954_85	1954_85	In addition we shall continue to protect and improve our national forests,  parks, monuments and other natural and historic sites, as well as our  fishery and wildlife resources. I hope that pending legislation to improve  the conservation and management of publicly_owned grazing lands in national  forests will soon be approved by the Congress.  
1954_86	1954_86	NATIONAL HIGHWAYS  
1954_91	1954_91	III. HUMAN PROBLEMS  
1954_95	1954_95	Protection against the hazards of temporary unemployment should be extended  to some 6 1/2 millions of workers, including civilian Federal workers, who  now lack this safeguard. Moreover, the Secretary of Labor is making  available to the states studies and recommendations in the fields of weekly  benefits, periods of protection and extension of coverage. The Economic  Report will consider the related matter of minimum wages and their coverage.  
1954_96	1954_96	The Labor Management Relations Act of 3947 is basically a sound law.  However, six years of experience have revealed that in some respects it can  be improved. On January 11, I shall forward to the Congress suggestions for  changes designed to reinforce the basic objectives of the Act.  
1954_102	1954_102	The Federal Government should encourage medical research in its battle with  such mortal diseases as cancer and heart ailments, and should continue to  help the states in their health and rehabilitation programs. The present  Hospital Survey and Construction Act should be broadened in order to assist  in the development of adequate facilities for the chronically ill, and to  encourage the construction of diagnostic centers, rehabilitation  facilities, and nursing homes. The war on disease also needs a better  working relationship between Government and private initiative. Private and  non_profit hospital and medical insurance plans are already in the field,  soundly based on the experience and initiative of the people in their  various communities.  
1954_106	1954_106	The preparation of teachers as, indeed, the control and direction of public  education policy, is a state and local responsibility. However, the Federal  Government should stand ready to assist states which demonstrably cannot  provide sufficient school buildings. In order to appraise the needs, I hope  that this year a conference on education will be held in each state,  culminating in a national conference. From these conferences on education,  every level of government from the Federal Government to each local school  board should gain the information with which to attack this serious  problem.  
1954_112	1954_112	Extension of the advantages of insured lending to private credit engaged in  this task of rehabilitating obsolete neighborhoods;  
1954_113	1954_113	Insurance of long_term, mortgage loans, with small down payment for  low_income families; and, until alternative programs prove more effective,  
1954_114	1954_114	Continuation of the public housing program adopted in the Housing Act of  1949.  
1954_116	1954_116	VETERANS ADMINISTRATION  
1954_118	1954_118	SUFFRAGE  
1954_119	1954_119	My few remaining recommendations all relate to a basic right of our  citizens that of being represented in the decisions of the government.  
1954_121	1954_121	In the District of Columbia the time is long overdue for granting national  suffrage to its citizens and also applying the principle of local  self_government to the Nation's Capital. I urge the Congress to move  promptly in this direction and also to revise District revenue measures to  provide needed public works improvements.  
1954_125	1954_125	I want to add one final word about the general purport of these many  recommendations.  
1954_128	1954_128	A government can sincerely strive for peace, as ours is striving, and ask  its people to make sacrifices for the sake of peace. But no government can  place peace in the hearts of foreign rulers. It is our duty then to  ourselves and to freedom itself to remain strong in all those  ways spiritual, economic, military that will give us maximum safety  against the possibility of aggressive action by others.  
1954_129	1954_129	No government can inoculate its people against the fatal materialism that  plagues our age. Happily, our people, though blessed with more material  goods than any people in history, have always reserved their first  allegiance to the kingdom of the spirit, which is the true source of that  freedom we value above all material things.  
1954_131	1954_131	The Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record  (vol. 100, p. 62).  
1955_2	1955_2	First, I extend cordial greetings to the 84th Congress. We shall have much  to do together; I am sure that we shall get it done and, that we shall do  it in harmony and good will.  
1955_3	1955_3	At the outset, I believe it would be well to remind ourselves of this great  fundamental in our national life: our common belief that every human being  is divinely endowed with dignity and worth and inalienable rights. This  faith, with its corollary that to grow and flourish people must be  free shapes the interests and aspirations of every American.  
1955_6	1955_6	Second, to help keep our economy vigorous and expanding, thus sustaining  our international strength and assuring better jobs, better living, better  opportunities for every citizen;  
1955_9	1955_9	It is of the utmost importance, that each of us understand the true nature  of the struggle now taking place in the world.  
1955_12	1955_12	In the past year, there has been progress justifying hope, both for  continuing peace and for the ultimate rule of freedom and justice in the  world. Free nations are collectively stronger than at any time in recent  years.  
1955_13	1955_13	Just as nations of this Hemisphere, in the historic Caracas and Rio  conferences, have closed ranks against imperialistic Communism and  strengthened their economic ties, so free nations elsewhere have forged new  bonds of unity.  
1955_14	1955_14	Recent agreements between Turkey and Pakistan have laid a foundation for  increased strength in the Middle East. With our understanding support,  Egypt and Britain, Yugoslavia and Italy, Britain and Iran have resolved  dangerous differences. The security of the Mediterranean has been enhanced  by an alliance among Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia. Agreements in Western  Europe have paved the way for unity to replace past divisions which have  undermined Europe's economic and military vitality. The defense of the West  appears likely at last to include a free, democratic Germany participating  as an equal in the councils of NATO.  
1955_15	1955_15	In Asia and the Pacific, the pending Manila Pact supplements our treaties  with Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Korea and Japan and our  prospective treaty with the Republic of China. These pacts stand as solemn  warning that future military aggression and subversion against the free  nations of Asia will meet united response. The Pacific Charter, also  adopted at Manila, is a milestone in the development of human freedom and  self_government in the Pacific area.  
1955_18	1955_18	These developments are heartening indeed, and we are hopeful of continuing  progress. But sobering problems remain.  
1955_20	1955_20	To protect our nations and our peoples from the catastrophe of a nuclear  holocaust, free nations must maintain countervailing military power to  persuade the Communists of the futility of seeking their ends through  aggression. If Communist rulers understand that America's response to  aggression will be swift and decisive that never shall we buy peace at the  expense of honor or faith they will be powerfully deterred from launching  a military venture engulfing their own peoples and many others in disaster.  This, of course, is merely world stalemate. But in this stalemate each of  us may and must exercise his high duty to strive in every honorable way for  enduring peace.  
1955_22	1955_22	In such a world, America's course is dear:  
1955_23	1955_23	We must tirelessly labor to make the peace more just and durable.  
1955_26	1955_26	We must also encourage the efforts being made in the United Nations to  limit armaments and to harness the atom to peaceful rise.  
1955_27	1955_27	We must expand international trade and investment and assist friendly  nations whose own best efforts are still insufficient to provide the  strength essential to the security of the free world.  
1955_28	1955_28	We must be willing to use the processes of negotiation whenever they will  advance the cause of just and secure peace to which the United States and  other free nations are dedicated.  
1955_30	1955_30	We must also carry forward our educational exchange program. This sharing  of knowledge and experience between our citizens and those of free  countries is a powerful factor in the development and maintenance of true  partnership among free peoples.  
1955_31	1955_31	To advance these many efforts, the Congress must act in this session on  appropriations, legislation, and treaties. Today I shall mention especially  our foreign economic and military programs.  
1955_39	1955_39	Third, to keep our armed forces abreast of the advances of science, our  military planning must be flexible enough to utilize the new weapons and  techniques which flow ever more speedily from our research and development  programs. The forthcoming military budget therefore emphasizes modern  airpower in the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and increases the emphasis  on new weapons, especially those of rapid and destructive striking power.  It assures the maintenance of effective, retaliatory force as the principal  deterrent to overt aggression. It accelerates the continental defense  program and the build_up of ready military reserve forces. It continues a  vigorous program of stockpiling strategic and critical materials and  strengthening our mobilization base. The budget also contemplates the  strategic concentration of our strength through redeployment of certain  forces. It provides for reduction of forces in certain categories and their  expansion in others, to fit them to the military realities of our time.  These emphases in our defense planning have been made at my personal  direction after long and thoughtful study. In my judgment, they will give  our nation a defense accurately adjusted to the national need.  
1955_41	1955_41	And fifth, in the administration of these costly programs, we must demand  the utmost in efficiency and ingenuity. We must assure our people not only  of adequate protection but also of a defense that can be carried forward  from year to year until the threat of aggression has disappeared.  
1955_43	1955_43	The first concerns the selective service act which expires next June 30th.  For the foreseeable future, our standing forces must remain much larger  than voluntary methods can sustain. We must, therefore, extend the  statutory authority to induct men for two years of military service.  
1955_46	1955_46	Maintenance of an effective defense requires continuance of our aggressive  attack on subversion at home. In this effort we have, in the past two  years, made excellent progress. FBI investigations have been powerfully  reinforced by a new Internal Security Division in the Department of  Justice; the security activities of the Immigration and Naturalization  Service have been revitalized; an improved and strengthened security system  is in effect throughout the government; the Department of Justice and the  FBI have been armed with effective new legal weapons forged by the 83rd  Congress.  
1955_47	1955_47	We shall continue to ferret out and to destroy Communist subversion.  
1955_48	1955_48	We shall, in the process, carefully preserve our traditions and the basic  rights of our citizens.  
1955_49	1955_49	Our civil defense program is also a key element in the protection of our  country. We are developing cooperative methods with State Governors,  Mayors, and voluntary citizen groups, as well as among Federal agencies, in  building the civil defense organization. Its significance in time of war is  obvious; its swift assistance in disaster areas last year proved its  importance in time of peace.  
1955_51	1955_51	At this time the executive and legislative branches are under the  management of different political parties. This fact places both parties on  trial before the American people.  
1955_54	1955_54	In all areas basic to the strength of America, there will be to the extent  I can insure them cooperative, constructive relations between the  Executive and Legislative Branches of this government. Let the general good  be our yardstick on every great issue of our time.  
1955_55	1955_55	Our efforts to defend our freedom and to secure a just peace are, of  course, inseparable from the second great purpose of our government: to  help maintain a strong, growing economy an economy vigorous and free, in  which there are ever_increasing opportunities, just rewards for effort, and  a stable prosperity that is widely shared.  
1955_58	1955_58	So, today, the transition to a peacetime economy is largely behind us.  
1955_59	1955_59	The economic outlook is good.  
1955_60	1955_60	The many promising factors I have mentioned do not guarantee sustained  economic expansion; however, they do give us a strong position from which  to carry forward our economic growth. If we as a people act wisely, within  ten years our annual national output can rise from its present level of  about $360 billion to $500 billion, measured in dollars of stable buying  power.  
1955_63	1955_63	Last year we had a large tax cut and, for the first time in seventy_five  years a basic revision of Federal tax laws. It is now clear that defense  and other essential government costs must remain at a level precluding  further tax reductions this year. Although excise and corporation income  taxes must, therefore, be continued at their present rates, further tax  cuts will be possible when justified by lower expenditures and by revenue  increases arising from the nation's economic growth. I am hopeful that such  reductions can be made next year.  
1955_68	1955_68	In addition, the 1956 budget will recommend appropriations to start six new  reclamation and more than thirty new Corps of Engineers projects of varying  size. Going projects and investigations of potential new resource  developments will be continued.  
1955_70	1955_70	In the interest of their proper conservation, development and use,  continued vigilance will be maintained over our fisheries, wildlife  resources, the national parks and forests, and the public lands; and we  shall continue to encourage an orderly development of the nation's mineral  resources.  
1955_74	1955_74	The Council of Economic Advisers, through its public works planning  section, has made important advances during the past year in effecting this  coordination and cooperation. In view of the success of these initial  efforts, and to give more emphasis and continuity to this essential  coordination, I shall request the Congress to appropriate funds for the  support of an Office of Coordinator of Public Works in the Executive Office  of the President.  
1955_77	1955_77	Thus, farm production is gradually adjusting to markets, markets are being  expanded, and stocks are moving into use. We can now look forward to an  easing of the influences depressing farm prices, to reduced government  expenditures for purchase of surplus products, and to less Federal  intrusion into the lives and plans of our farm people. Agricultural  programs have been redirected toward better balance, greater stability and  sustained prosperity. We are headed in the right direction. I urgently  recommend to the Congress that we continue resolutely on this road.  
1955_78	1955_78	Greater attention must be directed to the needs of low_income farm  families. Twenty_eight per cent of our farm_operator families have net cash  incomes of less than $1,000 per year. Last year, at my request, careful  studies were made of the problems of these farm people. I shall later  submit recommendations designed to assure the steady alleviation of their  most pressing concerns.  
1955_79	1955_79	Because drought also remains a serious agricultural problem, I shall  recommend legislation to strengthen Federal disaster assistance programs.  This legislation will prescribe an improved appraisal of need, better  adjustment of the various programs to local conditions, and a more  equitable sharing of costs between the States and the Federal Government.  
1955_81	1955_81	We come now to the third great purpose of our government_its concern for  the health, productivity and well_being of all our people.  
1955_84	1955_84	During the past two years, notable advances were made in these functions of  government. Protection of old_age and survivors' insurance was extended to  an additional ten million of our people, and the benefits were  substantially increased. Legislation was enacted to provide unemployment  insurance protection to some four million additional Americans.  Stabilization of living costs and the halting of inflation protected the  value of pensions and savings. A broad program now helps to bring good  homes within the reach of the great majority of our people. With the  States, we are providing rehabilitation facilities and more clinics,  hospitals, and nursing homes for patients with chronic illnesses. Also with  the States, we have begun a great and fruitful expansion in the restoration  of disabled persons to employment and useful lives. In the areas of Federal  responsibility, we have made historic progress in eliminating from among  our people demeaning practices based on race or color.  
1955_86	1955_86	As part of our efforts to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing for  low_income families, we must carry forward the housing program authorized  during the 83rd Congress. We must also authorize contracts for a firm  program of 35,000 additional public housing units in each of the next two  fiscal years. This program will meet the most pressing obligations of the  Federal Government into the 1958 fiscal year for planning and building  public housing. By that time the private building industry, aided by the  Housing Act of 1954, will have had the opportunity to assume its full role  in providing adequate housing for our low income families.  
1955_90	1955_90	My recommendations will include a Federal health reinsurance service to  encourage the development of more and better voluntary health insurance  coverage by private organizations. I shall also recommend measures to  improve the medical care of that group of our citizens who, because of  need, receive Federal_State public assistance. These two proposals will  help more of our people to meet the costs of health services.  
1955_91	1955_91	To reduce the gaps in these services, I shall propose:  
1955_97	1955_97	These measures together constitute a comprehensive program holding rich  promise for better health for all of our people.  
1955_101	1955_101	However, such factors as population growth, additional responsibilities of  schools, and increased and longer school attendance have produced an  unprecedented classroom shortage. This shortage is of immediate concern to  all of our people. Positive, affirmative action must be taken now.  
1955_106	1955_106	The outlook for our wage earners can be made still more promising by  several legislative actions.  
1955_109	1955_109	Third, the Administration will propose other important measures including  occupational safety, workmen's compensation for longshoremen and harbor  workers, and the "Eight Hour Laws" applicable to Federal contractors.  Legislation will also be proposed respecting nonoccupational disability  insurance and unemployment compensation in the District of Columbia.  
1955_114	1955_114	Our concern for the individual in our country requires that we consider  several additional problems.  
1955_116	1955_116	As the complex problems of Alaska are resolved, that Territory should  expect to achieve statehood. In the meantime, there is no justification for  deferring the admission to statehood of Hawaii. I again urge approval of  this measure.  
1955_121	1955_121	And now, I return to the point at which I began the faith of our people.  
1955_125	1955_125	To advance, not merely by our words but by our acts, the determination of  our government that every citizen shall have opportunity to develop to his  fullest capacity.  
1955_129	1955_129	The address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record  (vol. 101, p. 94).  
1956_1	1956_1	To the Congress of the United States:  
1956_3	1956_3	In the past three years, responding to what our people want their  Government to do, the Congress and the Executive have done much in building  a stronger, better America. There has been broad progress in fostering the  energies of our people, in providing greater opportunity for the  satisfaction of their needs, and in fulfilling their demands for the  strength and security of the Republic.  
1956_6	1956_6	War in Korea ended two and a half years ago. The collective security system  has been powerfully strengthened. Our defenses have been reinforced at  sharply reduced costs. Programs to expand world trade and to harness the  atom for the betterment of mankind have been carried forward. Our economy  has been freed from governmental wage and price controls. Inflation has  been halted; the cost of living stabilized.  
1956_7	1956_7	Government spending has been cut by more than ten billion dollars. Nearly  three hundred thousand positions have been eliminated from the Federal  payroll. Taxes have been substantially reduced. A balanced budget is in  prospect. Social security has been extended to ten million more Americans  and unemployment insurance to four million more. Unprecedented advances in  civil rights have been made. The long_standing and deep_seated problems of  agriculture have been forthrightly attacked.  
1956_10	1956_10	Many measures of great national importance recommended last year to the  Congress still demand immediate attention legislation for school and  highway construction; health and immigration legislation; water resources  legislation; legislation to complete the implementation of our foreign  economic policy; such labor legislation as amendments of the  Labor_Management Relations Act, extension of the Fair Labor Standards Act  to additional groups not now covered, and occupational safety legislation;  and legislation for construction of an atomic_powered exhibit vessel.  
1956_15	1956_15	THE DISCHARGE OF OUR WORLD RESPONSIBILITY  
1956_16	1956_16	Our world policy and our actions are dedicated to the achievement of peace  with justice for all nations.  
1956_20	1956_20	Nevertheless, it is clear that the conflict between international communism  and freedom has taken on a new complexion.  
1956_23	1956_23	In the face of Communist military power, we must, of course, continue to  maintain an effective system of collective security. This involves two  things a system which gives clear warning that armed aggression will be  met by joint action of the free nations, and deterrent military power to  make that warning effective. Moreover, the awesome power of the atom must  be made to serve as a guardian of the free community and of the peace.  
1956_28	1956_28	In the coming year much remains to be done.  
1956_30	1956_30	In the Near East we shall spare no effort in seeking to promote a fair  solution of the tragic dispute between the Arab States and Israel, all of  whom we want as our friends. The United States is ready to do its part to  assure enduring peace in that area. We hope that both sides will make the  contributions necessary to achieve that purpose. In Latin America, we shall  continue to cooperate vigorously in trade and other measures designed to  assist economic progress in the area.  
1956_43	1956_43	THE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY  
1956_44	1956_44	Because peace is the keystone of our national policy, our defense program  emphasizes an effective flexible type of power calculated to deter or  repulse any aggression and to preserve the peace. Short of war, we have  never had military strength better adapted to our needs with improved  readiness for emergency use. The maintenance of this strong military  capability for the indefinite future will continue to call for a large  share of our national budget. Our military programs must meet the needs of  today. To build less would expose the nation to aggression. To build  excessively, under the influence of fear, could defeat our purposes and  impair or destroy the very freedom and economic system our military  defenses are designed to protect.  
1956_45	1956_45	We have improved the effectiveness and combat readiness of our forces by  developing and making operational new weapons and by integrating the latest  scientific developments, including new atomic weapons, into our military  plans. We continue to push the production of the most modern military  aircraft. The development of long_range missiles has been on an accelerated  basis for some time. We are moving as rapidly as practicable toward  nuclear_powered aircraft and ships. Combat capability, especially in terms  of firepower, has been substantially increased. We have made the  adjustments in personnel permitted by the cessation of the Korean War, the  buildup of our allies and the introduction of new weapons. The services are  all planning realistically on a long_term basis.  
1956_47	1956_47	In the last analysis our real strength lies in the caliber of the men and  women in our Armed Forces, active and Reserve. Much has been done to  attract and hold capable military personnel, but more needs to be done.  This year, I renew my request of last year for legislation to provide  proper medical care for military dependents and a more equitable survivors'  benefit program. The Administration will prepare additional recommendations  designed to achieve the same objectives, including career incentives for  medical and dental officers and nurses, and increases in the proportion of  regular officers.  
1956_48	1956_48	Closely related to the mission of the Defense Department is the task of the  Federal Civil Defense Administration. A particular point of relationship  arises from the fact that the key to civil defense is the expanded  continental defense program, including the distant early warning system.  Our Federal civil defense authorities have made progress in their program,  and now comprehensive studies are being conducted jointly by the Federal  Civil Defense Administration, the States, and critical target cities to  determine the best procedures that can be adopted in case of an atomic  attack. We must strengthen Federal assistance to the States and cities in  devising the most effective common defense.  
1956_51	1956_51	A third objective of the Administration is:  
1956_53	1956_53	A public office is, indeed, a public trust. None of its aspects is more  demanding than the proper management of the public finances. I refer now  not only to the indispensable virtues of plain honesty and trustworthiness  but also to the prudent, effective and conscientious use of tax money. I  refer also to the attitude of mind that makes efficient and economical  service to the people a watchword in our government.  
1956_54	1956_54	Over the long term, a balanced budget is a sure index to thrifty  management in a home, in a business or in the Federal Government. When  achievement of a balanced budget is for long put off in a business or home,  bankruptcy is the result. But in similar circumstances a government resorts  to inflation of the money supply. This inevitably results in depreciation  of the value of the money, and an increase in the cost of living. Every  investment in personal security is threatened by this process of inflation,  and the real values of the people's savings, whether in the form of  insurance, bonds, pension and retirement funds or savings accounts are  thereby shriveled.  
1956_55	1956_55	We have made long strides these past three years in bringing our Federal  finances under control. The deficit for fiscal year 1953 was almost 9_1/2  billion dollars. Larger deficits seemed certain deficits which would have  depreciated the value of the dollar and pushed the cost of living still  higher. But government waste and extravagance were searched out.  Nonessential activities were dropped. Government expenses were carefully  scrutinized. Total spending was cut by 14 billion dollars below the amount  planned by the previous Administration for the fiscal year 1954.  
1956_56	1956_56	This made possible and it was appropriate in the existing circumstances of  transition to a peacetime economy the largest tax cut in any year in our  history. Almost 7_1/2 billion dollars were released and every taxpayer in  the country benefited. Almost two_thirds of the savings went directly to  individuals. This tax cut also helped to build up the economy, to make jobs  in industry and to increase the production .of the many things desired to  improve the scale of living for the great majority of Americans.  
1956_57	1956_57	The strong expansion of the economy, coupled with a constant care for  efficiency in government operations and an alert guard against waste and  duplication, has brought us to a prospective balance between income and  expenditure. This is being done while we continue to strengthen our  military security.  
1956_61	1956_61	It is unquestionably true that our present tax level is very burdensome  and, in the interest of long term and continuous economic growth, should be  reduced when we prudently can. It is essential, in the sound management of  the Government's finances, that we be mindful of our enormous national debt  and of the obligation we have toward future Americans to reduce that debt  whenever we can appropriately do so. Under conditions of high peacetime  prosperity, such as now exist, we can never justify going further into debt  to give ourselves a tax cut at the expense of our children. So, in the  present state of our financial affairs, I earnestly believe that a tax cut  can be deemed justifiable only when it will not unbalance the budget, a  budget which makes provision for some reduction, even though modest, in our  national debt. In this way we can best maintain fiscal integrity.  
1956_62	1956_62	A fourth aim of our program is:  
1956_63	1956_63	TO FOSTER A STRONG ECONOMY  
1956_68	1956_68	In successful prosecution of the war, the nation called for the utmost  effort of its farmers. Their response was superb, their contribution  unsurpassed. Farmers are not now to be blamed for the mountainous,  price_depressing surpluses produced in response to wartime policies and  laws that were too long continued. War markets are not the markets of  peacetime. Failure to recognize that basic fact by a timely adjustment of  wartime legislation brought its inevitable result in peacetime surpluses,  lower prices and lower incomes for our farmers.  
1956_77	1956_77	I shall briefly mention four other subjects directly related to the  well_being of the economy, preliminary to their fuller discussion in the  Economic Report and later communications.  
1956_80	1956_80	A comprehensive legislative program for water conservation will be  submitted to the Congress during the Session. The development of our water  resources cannot be accomplished overnight. The need is such that we must  make faster progress and without delay. Therefore, I strongly recommend  that action be taken at this Session on such wholly Federal projects as the  Colorado River Storage Project and the Fryingpan_Arkansas Project; on the  John Day partnership project, and other projects which provide for  cooperative action between the Federal Government and non_Federal  interests; and on legislation, which makes provision for Federal  participation in small projects under the primary sponsorship of agencies  of State and local government.  
1956_85	1956_85	Area Redevelopment  
1956_88	1956_88	Highway Legislation.  
1956_90	1956_90	In my message of February 22, 1955, I urged that measures be taken to  complete the vital 40,000 mile interstate system over a period of 10 years  at an estimated Federal cost of approximately 25 billion dollars. No  program was adopted.  
1956_92	1956_92	Aside from agriculture and the four subjects specifically mentioned, an  integral part of our efforts to foster a strong and expanding free economy  is keeping open the door of opportunity to new and small enterprises,  checking monopoly, and preserving a competitive environment. In this past  year the steady improvement in the economic health of small business has  reinforced the vitality of our competitive economy. We shall continue to  help small business concerns to obtain access to adequate financing and to  competent counsel on management, production, and marketing problems.  
1956_101	1956_101	A fundamental belief shines forth in this Republic. We believe in the worth  and dignity of the individual. We know that if we are to govern ourselves  wisely in the tradition of America we must have the opportunity to  develop our individual capacities to the utmost.  
1956_108	1956_108	Other needs in the area of social welfare include increased child welfare  services, extension of the program of aid to dependent children,  intensified attack on juvenile delinquency, and special attention to the  problems of mentally retarded children. The training of more skilled  workers for these fields and the quest for new knowledge through research  in social welfare are essential. Similarly the problems of our aged people  need our attention.  
1956_112	1956_112	The response of government to human concerns embraces, of course, other  measures of broad public interest, and of special interest to our working  men and women. The need still exists for improvement of the Labor  Management Relations Act. The recommendations I submitted to the Congress  last year take into account not only the interests of labor and management  but also the public welfare. The needed amendments should be enacted  without further delay.  
1956_115	1956_115	In the field of human needs, we must carry forward the housing program,  which is contributing so greatly to the well_being of our people and the  prosperity of our economy. Home ownership is now advanced to the point  where almost three of every five families in our cities, towns, and suburbs  own the houses they live in.  
1956_118	1956_118	With so large a number of the American people desiring to modernize and  improve existing dwellings, I recommend that the Title 1 program for  permanent improvements in the home be liberalized.  
1956_120	1956_120	The legislation I have recommended for workers in private industry should  be accompanied by a parallel effort for the welfare of Government  employees. We have accomplished much in this field, including a  contributory life insurance program; equitable pay increases and a fringe  benefits program, covering many needed personnel policy changes, from  improved premium pay to a meaningful incentive award program.  
1956_121	1956_121	Additional personnel management legislation is needed in this Session. As I  stated last year, an executive pay increase is essential to efficient  governmental management. Such an increase, together with needed adjustments  in the pay for the top career positions, is also necessary to the equitable  completion of the Federal pay program initiated last year. Other  legislation will be proposed, including legislation for prepaid group  health insurance for employees and their dependents and to effect major  improvements in the Civil Service retirement system.  
1956_123	1956_123	We are proud of the progress our people have made in the field of civil  rights. In Executive Branch operations throughout the nation, elimination  of discrimination and segregation is all but completed. Progress is also  being made among contractors engaged in furnishing Government services and  requirements. Every citizen now has the opportunity to fit himself for and  to hold a position of responsibility in the service of his country. In the  District of Columbia, through the voluntary cooperation of the people,  discrimination and segregation are disappearing from hotels, theaters,  restaurants and other facilities.  
1956_124	1956_124	It is disturbing that in some localities allegations persist that Negro  citizens are being deprived of their right to vote and are likewise being  subjected to unwarranted economic pressures. I recommend that the substance  of these charges be thoroughly examined by a Bipartisan Commission created  by the Congress. It is hoped that such a commission will be established  promptly so that it may arrive at findings which can receive early  consideration.  
1956_129	1956_129	In keeping with our responsibility of world leadership and in our own self  interest, I again point out to the Congress the urgent need for revision of  the immigration and nationality laws. Our nation has always welcomed  immigrants to our shores. The wisdom of such a policy is clearly shown by  the fact that America has been built by immigrants and the descendants of  immigrants. That policy must be continued realistically with present day  conditions in mind.  
1956_131	1956_131	The law should be amended to permit the Secretary of State and the Attorney  General to waive the requirements of fingerprinting on a reciprocal basis  for persons coming to this country for temporary visits. This and other  changes in the law are long overdue and should be taken care of promptly.  Detailed recommendations for revision of the immigration laws will be  submitted to the Congress.  
1956_132	1956_132	I am happy to report substantial progress in the flow of immigrants under  the Refugee Relief Act of 1953; however, I again request this Congress to  approve without further delay the urgently needed amendments to that act  which I submitted in the last Session. Because of the high prosperity in  Germany and Austria, the number of immigrants from those countries will be  reduced. This will make available thousands of unfilled openings which I  recommend be distributed to Greece and Italy and to escapees from behind  the Iron Curtain.  
1956_133	1956_133	Once again I ask the Congress to join with me in demonstrating our belief  in the right of suffrage. I renew my request that the principle of  self_government be extended and the right of suffrage granted to the  citizens of the District of Columbia.  
1956_135	1956_135	Progress, however, will be realized only as it is more than matched by a  continuing growth in the spiritual strength of the nation. Our dedication  to moral values must be complete in our dealings abroad and in our  relationships among ourselves. We have single_minded devotion to the common  good of America. Never must we forget that this means the well_being, the  prosperity, the security of all Americans in every walk of life.  
1957_1	1957_1	To the Congress of the United States:  
1957_4	1957_4	In the world today, the surging and understandable tide of nationalism is  marked by widespread revulsion and revolt against tyranny, injustice,  inequality and poverty. As individuals, joined in a common hunger for  freedom, men and women and even children pit their spirit against guns and  tanks. On a larger scale, in an ever more persistent search for the  self_respect of authentic sovereignty and the economic base on which  national independence must rest, peoples sever old ties; seek new  alliances; experiment sometimes dangerously in their struggle to satisfy  these human aspirations.  
1957_14	1957_14	Through the past four years these principles have guided the legislative  programs submitted by the Administration to the Congress. As we attempt to  apply them to current events, domestic and foreign, we must take into  account the complex entity that is the United States of America; what  endangers it; what can improve it.  
1957_15	1957_15	The visible structure is our American economy itself. After more than a  century and a half of constant expansion, it is still rich in a wide  variety of natural resources. It is first among nations in its people's  mastery of industrial skills. It is productive beyond our own needs of many  foodstuffs and industrial products. It is rewarding to all our citizens in  opportunity to earn and to advance in self_realization and in  self_expression. It is fortunate in its wealth of educational and cultural  and religious centers. It is vigorously dynamic in the limitless initiative  and willingness to venture that characterize free enterprise. It is  productive of a widely shared prosperity.  
1957_21	1957_21	In this regard I call on leaders in business and in labor to think well on  their responsibility to the American people. With all elements of our  society, they owe the Nation a vigilant guard against the inflationary  tendencies that are always at work in a dynamic economy operating at  today's high levels. They can powerfully help counteract or accentuate such  tendencies by their wage and price policies.  
1957_28	1957_28	In the light of this report, there are two things I believe we should keep  constantly in mind. The first is that each of our great river valleys  should be considered as a whole. Piecemeal operations within each lesser  drainage area can be self_defeating or, at the very least, needlessly  expensive. The second is that the domestic and industrial demands for water  grow far more rapidly than does our population.  
1957_43	1957_43	The Administration will, through future messages either directly from me or  from heads of the departments and agencies, transmit to the Congress  specific recommendations. These will involve our financial and fiscal  affairs, our military and civil defenses; the administration of justice;  our agricultural economy; our domestic and foreign commerce; the urgently  needed increase in our postal rates; the development of our natural  resources; our labor laws, including our labor_management relations  legislation, and vital aspects of the health, education and welfare of our  people. There will be special recommendations dealing with such subjects as  atomic energy, the furthering of public works, the continued efforts to  eliminate government competition with the businesses of tax_paying  citizens.  
1957_48	1957_48	Another truth is that our survival in today's world requires modern,  adequate, dependable military strength. Our Nation has made great strides  in assuring a modern defense, so armed in new weapons, so deployed, so  equipped, that today our security force is the most powerful in our  peacetime history. It can punish heavily any enemy who undertakes to attack  us. It is a major deterrent to war.  
1957_55	1957_55	This quest requires as well a constructive attitude among all the nations  of the free world toward expansion of trade and investment, that can give  all of us opportunity to work out economic betterment.  
1957_59	1957_59	World events have magnified both the responsibilities and the opportunities  of the United States Information Agency. Just as, in recent months, the  voice of communism has become more shaken and confused, the voice of truth  must be more clearly heard. To enable our Information Agency to cope with  these new responsibilities and opportunities, I am asking the Congress to  increase appreciably the appropriations for this program and for  legislation establishing a career service for the Agency's overseas foreign  service officers.  
1957_60	1957_60	The recent historic events in Hungary demand that all free nations share to  the extent of their capabilities in the responsibility of granting asylum  to victims of Communist persecution. I request the Congress promptly to  enact legislation to regularize the status in the United States of  Hungarian refugees brought here as parolees. I shall shortly recommend to  the Congress by special message the changes in our immigration laws that I  deem necessary in the light of our world responsibilities.  
1957_62	1957_62	Only five days ago I expressed to you the grave concern of your Government  over the threat of Soviet aggression in the Middle East. I asked for  Congressional authorization to help counter this threat. I say again that  this matter is of vital and immediate importance to the Nation's and the  free world's security and peace. By our proposed programs in the Middle  East, we hope to assist in establishing a climate in which constructive and  long_term solutions to basic problems of the area may be sought.  
1957_69	1957_69	In short, the world has so shrunk that all free nations are our neighbors.  Without cooperative neighbors, the United States cannot maintain its own  security and welfare, because:  
1957_70	1957_70	First, America's vital interests are world_wide, embracing both hemispheres  and every continent.  
1957_74	1957_74	May we at home, here at the Seat of Government, in all the cities and towns  and farmlands of America, support these principles in a personal effort of  dedication. Thereby each of us can help establish a secure world order in  which opportunity for freedom and justice will be more widespread, and in  which the resources now dissipated on the armaments of war can be released  for the life and growth of all humanity.  
1957_78	1957_78	Our country and its government have made mistakes human mistakes. They  have been of the head not of the heart. And it is still true that the  great concept of the dignity of all men, alike created in the image of the  Almighty, has been the compass by which we have tried and are trying to  steer our course.  
1957_80	1957_80	To achieve a more perfect fidelity to it, I submit, is a worthy ambition as  we meet together in these first days of this, the first session of the 85th  Congress.  
1957_81	1957_81	The Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record  (vol. 103, p. 387).  
1958_1	1958_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 85th Congress:  
1958_7	1958_7	There are two tasks confronting us that so far outweigh all other that I  shall devote this year's message entirely to them. The first is to ensure  our safety through strength.  
1958_8	1958_8	As to our strength, I have repeatedly voiced this conviction: We now have a  broadly based and efficient defensive strength, including a great deterrent  power, which is, for the present, our main guarantee against war; but,  unless we act wisely and promptly, we could lose that capacity to deter  attack or defend ourselves.  
1958_9	1958_9	My profoundest conviction is that the American people will say, as one man:  No matter what the exertions or sacrifices, we shall maintain that  necessary strength!  
1958_10	1958_10	But we could make no more tragic mistake than merely to concentrate on  military strength.  
1958_11	1958_11	For if we did only this, the future would hold nothing for the world but an  Age of Terror.  
1958_16	1958_16	But what makes the Soviet threat unique in history is its  all inclusiveness. Every human activity is pressed into service as a  weapon of expansion. Trade, economic development, military power, arts,  science, education, the whole world of ideas all are harnessed to this  same chariot of expansion.  
1958_17	1958_17	The Soviets are, in short, waging total cold war.  
1958_18	1958_18	The only answer to a regime that wages total cold war is to wage total  peace.  
1958_21	1958_21	Military power serves the cause of security by making prohibitive the cost  of any aggressive attack.  
1958_29	1958_29	At this moment, the consensus of opinion is that we are probably somewhat  behind the Soviets in some areas of long_range ballistic missile  development. But it is my conviction, based on close study of all relevant  intelligence, that if we make the necessary effort, we will have the  missiles, in the needed quantity and in time, to sustain and strengthen the  deterrent power of our increasingly efficient bombers. One encouraging fact  evidencing this ability is the rate of progress we have achieved since we  began to concentrate on these missiles.  
1958_30	1958_30	The intermediate ballistic missiles, Thor and Jupiter, have already been  ordered into production. The parallel progress in the intercontinental  ballistic missile effort will be advanced by our plans for acceleration.  The development of the submarine_based Polaris missile system has  progressed so well that its future procurement schedules are being moved  forward markedly.  
1958_38	1958_38	Up to this point, I have talked solely about our military strength to deter  a possible future war.  
1958_43	1958_43	Admittedly, most of us did not anticipate the psychological impact upon the  world of the launching of the first earth satellite. Let us not make the  same kind of mistake in another field, by failing to anticipate the much  more serious impact of the Soviet economic offensive.  
1958_46	1958_46	If our history teaches us anything, it is this lesson: so far as the  economic potential of our nation is concerned, the believers in the future  of America have always been the realists. I count myself as one of this  company.  
1958_52	1958_52	1. DEFENSE REORGANIZATION  
1958_53	1958_53	The first need is to assure ourselves that military organization  facilitates rather than hinders the functioning of the military  establishment in maintaining the security of the nation.  
1958_54	1958_54	Since World War II, the purpose of achieving maximum organizational  efficiency in a modern defense establishment has several times occasioned  action by the Congress and by the Executive.  
1958_55	1958_55	The advent of revolutionary new devices, bringing with them the problem of  overall continental defense, creates new difficulties, reminiscent of those  attending the advent of the airplane half a century ago.  
1958_56	1958_56	Some of the important new weapons which technology has produced do not fit  into any existing service pattern. They cut across all services, involve  all services, and transcend all services, at every stage from development  to operation. In some instances they defy classification according to  branch of service.  
1958_59	1958_59	I am not attempting today to pass judgment on the charge of harmful service  rivalries. But one thing is sure. Whatever they are, America wants them  stopped.  
1958_61	1958_61	Meanwhile, without anticipating the detailed form that a reorganization  should take, I can state its main lines in terms of objectives:  
1958_64	1958_64	In recognition of the need for single control in some of our most advanced  development projects, the Secretary of Defense has already decided to  concentrate into one organization all the anti_missile and satellite  technology undertaken within the Department of Defense.  
1958_65	1958_65	Another requirement of military organization is a clear subordination of  the military services to duly constituted civilian authority. This control  must be real; not merely on the surface.  
1958_66	1958_66	Next there must be assurance that an excessive number of compartments in  organization will not create costly and confusing compartments in our  scientific and industrial effort.  
1958_69	1958_69	The second major action item is the acceleration of the defense effort in  particular areas affected by the fast pace of scientific and technological  advance.  
1958_72	1958_72	We must protect and disperse our striking forces and increase their  readiness for instant reaction. This means more base facilities and standby  crews.  
1958_73	1958_73	We must maintain deterrent retaliatory power. This means, among other  things, stepped_up long range missile programs; accelerated programs for  other effective missile systems; and, for some years, more advanced  aircraft.  
1958_81	1958_81	As for the mutual economic assistance program, the benefit to us is  threefold. First, the countries receiving this aid become bulwarks against  communist encroachment as their military defenses and economies are  strengthened. Nations that are conscious of a steady improvement in their  industry, education, health and standard of living are not apt to fall prey  to the blandishments of communist imperialists.  
1958_83	1958_83	Third, the mutual confidence that comes from working together on  constructive projects creates an atmosphere in which real understanding and  peace can flourish.  
1958_85	1958_85	In proposals for future economic aid, I am stressing a greater use of  repayable loans, through the Development Loan Fund, through funds generated  by sale of surplus farm products, and through the Export_Import Bank.  
1958_87	1958_87	One great obstacle to the economic aid program in the past has been, not a  rational argument against it on the merits, but a catchword: "give_away  program."  
1958_88	1958_88	The real fact is that no investment we make in our own security and peace  can pay us greater dividends than necessary amounts of economic aid to  friendly nations.  
1958_94	1958_94	World trade supports a significant segment of American industry and  agriculture. It provides employment for four and one_half million American  workers. It helps supply our ever increasing demand for raw materials. It  provides the opportunity for American free enterprise to develop on a  worldwide scale. It strengthens our friends and increases their desire to  be friends. World trade helps to lay the groundwork for peace by making all  free nations of the world stronger and more self_reliant.  
1958_95	1958_95	America is today the world's greatest trading nation. If we use this great  asset wisely to meet the expanding demands of the world, we shall not only  provide future opportunities for our own business, agriculture, and labor,  but in the process strengthen our security posture and other prospects for  a prosperous, harmonious world.  
1958_96	1958_96	As President McKinley said, as long ago as 1901: "Isolation is no longer  possible or desirable .... The period of exclusiveness is past."  
1958_97	1958_97	5. SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION WITH OUR ALLIES  
1958_99	1958_99	It is wasteful in the extreme for friendly allies to consume talent and  money in solving problems that their friends have already solved all  because of artificial barriers to sharing. We cannot afford to cut  ourselves off from the brilliant talents and minds of scientists in  friendly countries. The task ahead will be hard enough without handcuffs of  our own making.  
1958_100	1958_100	The groundwork for this kind of cooperation has already been laid in  discussions among NATO countries. Promptness in following through with  legislation will be the best possible evidence of American unity of purpose  in cooperating with our friends.  
1958_105	1958_105	But Federal action can do only a part of the job. In both education and  research, redoubled exertions will be necessary on the part of all  Americans if we are to rise to the demands of our times. This means hard  work on the part of state and local governments, private industry, schools  and colleges, private organizations and foundations, teachers, parents,  and perhaps most important of all the student himself, with his bag of  books and his homework.  
1958_106	1958_106	With this kind of all_inclusive campaign, I have no doubt that we can  create the intellectual capital we need for the years ahead, invest it in  the right places and do all this, not as regimented pawns, but as free men  and women!  
1958_108	1958_108	Seventh: To provide for this extra effort for security, we must apply stern  tests of priority to other expenditures, both military and civilian. This  extra effort involves, most immediately, the need for a supplemental  defense appropriation of $1.3 billion for fiscal year 1958.  
1958_120	1958_120	Now, may I try to give you some concrete examples of the kind of works of  peace that might make a beginning in the new direction.  
1958_123	1958_123	Indeed, we would be willing to pool our efforts with the Soviets in other  campaigns against the diseases that are the common enemy of all  mortals such as cancer and heart disease.  
1958_128	1958_128	But of all the works of peace, none is more needed now than a real first  step toward disarmament.  
1958_130	1958_130	But the world cannot afford to stand still on disarmament! We must never  give up the search for a basis of agreement.  
1958_132	1958_132	But a disarmament proposal, to hold real promise, must at the minimum have  one feature: reliable means to ensure compliance by all. It takes actions  and demonstrated integrity on both sides to create and sustain confidence.  And confidence in a genuine disarmament agreement is vital, not only to the  signers of the agreement, but also to the millions of people all over the  world who are weary of tensions and armaments.  
1958_133	1958_133	I say once more, to all peoples, that we will always go the extra mile with  anyone on earth if it will bring us nearer a genuine peace.  
1958_134	1958_134	CONCLUSION  
1958_135	1958_135	These, then, are the ways in which we must funnel our energies more  efficiently into the task of advancing security and peace.  
1958_137	1958_137	After all, it is no good demanding sacrifice in general terms one day, and  the next day, for local reasons, opposing the elimination of some unneeded  Federal facility.  
1958_140	1958_140	My friends of the Congress: The world is waiting to see how wisely and  decisively a free representative government will now act.  
1958_141	1958_141	I believe that this Congress possesses and will display the wisdom promptly  to do its part in translating into law the actions demanded by our nation's  interests. But, to make law effective, our kind of government needs the  full voluntary support of millions of Americans for these actions.  
1959_1	1959_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 86th Congress, my fellow  citizens:  
1959_9	1959_9	We cannot build peace through desire alone. Moreover, we have learned the  bitter lesson that international agreements, historically considered by us  as sacred, are regarded in Communist doctrine and in practice to be mere  scraps of paper. The most recent proof of their disdain of international  obligations, solemnly undertaken, is their announced intention to abandon  their responsibilities respecting Berlin.  
1959_12	1959_12	To achieve this peace we seek to prevent war at any place and in any  dimension. If, despite our best efforts, a local dispute should flare into  armed hostilities, the next problem would be to keep the conflict from  spreading, and so compromising freedom. In support of these objectives we  maintain forces of great power and flexibility.  
1959_13	1959_13	Our formidable air striking forces are a powerful deterrent to general war.  Large and growing portions of these units can depart from their bases in a  matter of minutes.  
1959_17	1959_17	Great strides have been made in the development of ballistic missiles.  Intermediate range missiles are now being deployed in operational units.  The Arias intercontinental ballistic missile program has been marked by  rapid development as evidenced by recent successful tests. Missile training  units have been established and launching sites are far along in  construction.  
1959_19	1959_19	We have successfully placed five satellites in orbit, which have gathered  information of scientific importance never before available. Our latest  satellite illustrates our steady advance in rocketry and foreshadows new  developments in world_wide communications.  
1959_21	1959_21	Our atomic submarines have shattered endurance records and made historic  voyages under the North Polar Sea.  
1959_23	1959_23	All this is given only as a matter of history; as a record of our progress  in space and ballistic missile fields in no more than four years of  intensive effort. At the same time we clearly recognize that some of the  recent Soviet accomplishments in this particular technology are indeed  brilliant.  
1959_24	1959_24	Under the law enacted last year the Department of Defense is being  reorganized to give the Secretary of Defense full authority over the  military establishment. Greater efficiency, more cohesive effort and  speedier reaction to emergencies are among the many advantages we are  already noting from these changes.  
1959_26	1959_26	National Security programs account for nearly sixty percent of the entire  Federal budget for this coming fiscal year.  
1959_29	1959_29	This year we are investing an aggregate of close to $7 billion in missile  programs alone.  
1959_31	1959_31	Our latest atomic submarines will cost $50 millions each, while some  special types will cost three times as much.  
1959_32	1959_32	We are now ordering fighter aircraft which are priced at fifty times as  much as the fighters of World War II.  
1959_35	1959_35	Such expenditures demand both balance and perspective in our planning for  defense. At every turn, we must weigh, judge and select. Needless  duplication of weapons and forces must be avoided.  
1959_36	1959_36	We must guard against feverish building of vast armaments to meet glibly  predicted moments of so_called "maximum peril." The threat we face is not  sporadic or dated: It is continuous. Hence we must not be swayed in our  calculations either by groundless fear or by complacency. We must avoid  extremes, for vacillation between extremes is inefficient, costly, and  destructive of morale. In these days of unceasing technological advance, we  must plan our defense expenditures systematically and with care, fully  recognizing that obsolescence compels the never_ending replacement of older  weapons with new ones.  
1959_37	1959_37	The defense budget for the coming year has been planned on the basis of  these principles and considerations. Over these many months I have  personally participated in its development.  
1959_38	1959_38	The aim is a sensible posture of defense. The secondary aim is increased  efficiency and avoidance of waste. Both are achieved by this budgetary  plan.  
1959_41	1959_41	Constantly we seek new ways to make more effective our contribution to this  system of collective security. Recently I have asked a Committee of eminent  Americans of both parties to re_appraise our military assistance programs  and the relative emphasis which should be placed on military and economic  aid.  
1959_43	1959_43	Any survey of the free world's defense structure cannot fail to impart a  feeling of regret that so much of our effort and resources must be devoted  to armaments. At Geneva and elsewhere we continue to seek technical and  other agreements that may help to open up, with some promise, the issues of  international disarmament. America will never give up the hope that  eventually all nations can, with mutual confidence, drastically reduce  these non_productive expenditures. II.  
1959_44	1959_44	The material foundation of our national safety is a strong and expanding  economy. This we have and this we must maintain. Only with such an economy  can we be secure and simultaneously provide for the well_being of our  people.  
1959_48	1959_48	After we have provided wisely for our military strength, we must judge how  to allocate our remaining government resources most effectively to promote  our well_being and economic growth.  
1959_49	1959_49	Federal programs that will benefit all citizens are moving forward.  
1959_51	1959_51	Each of these additional outlays is being made necessary by the surging  growth of America.  
1959_52	1959_52	Let me illustrate. Responsive to this growth, Federal grants and long term  loans to assist 14 major types of capital improvements in our cities will  total over 2 billion dollars in 1960 double the expenditure of two years  ago. The major responsibility for development in these fields rests in the  localities, even though the Federal Government will continue to do its  proper part in meeting the genuine needs of a burgeoning population.  
1959_53	1959_53	But the progress of our economy can more than match the growth of our  needs. We need only to act wisely and confidently.  
1959_55	1959_55	The basic question facing us today is more than mere survival the military  defense of national life and territory. It is the preservation of a way of  life.  
1959_60	1959_60	To define these goals, I intend to mobilize help from every available  source.  
1959_65	1959_65	We must have teachers of competence. To obtain and hold them we need  standards. We need a National Goal. Once established I am certain that  public opinion would compel steady progress toward its accomplishment.  
1959_66	1959_66	Such studies would be helpful, I believe, to government at all levels and  to all individuals. The goals so established could help us see our current  needs in perspective. They will spur progress.  
1959_68	1959_68	We must avoid any contribution to inflationary processes, which could  disrupt sound growth in our economy.  
1959_69	1959_69	Prices have displayed a welcome stability in recent months and, if we are  wise and resolute, we will not tolerate inflation in the years to come. But  history makes clear the risks inherent in any failure to deal firmly with  the .basic causes of inflation. Two of the most important of these causes  are the wage_price spiral and continued deficit financing.  
1959_72	1959_72	Inflation can be prevented. But this demands statesmanship on the part of  business and labor leaders and of government at all levels.  
1959_75	1959_75	First, I shall submit a balanced budget for the next year, a year expected  to be the most prosperous in our history. It is a realistic budget with  wholly attainable objectives.  
1959_79	1959_79	In this hope, I am requesting the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare  appropriate proposals for revising, at the proper time, our tax structure,  to remove inequities and to enhance incentives for all Americans to work,  to save, and to invest. Such recommendations will be made as soon as our  fiscal condition permits. These prospects will be brightened if 1960  expenditures do not exceed the levels recommended.  
1959_80	1959_80	Second, I shall recommend to the Congress that the Chief Executive be given  the responsibility either to approve or to veto specific items in  appropriations and authorization bills. This would save tax dollars.  
1959_84	1959_84	By the end of this fiscal year it is estimated that there will be in  Government hands surplus farm products worth about nine billion dollars.  And by July 1, 1959, Government expenditures for storage, interest, and  handling of its agricultural inventory will reach a rate of one billion  dollars a year.  
1959_85	1959_85	This level of expenditure for farm products could be made willingly for a  temporary period if it were leading to a sound solution of the problem. But  unfortunately this is not true. We need new legislation.  
1959_88	1959_88	These fiscal and related actions will help create an environment of price  stability for economic growth. However, certain additional measures are  needed.  
1959_90	1959_90	I am establishing a continuing Cabinet group on Price Stability for  Economic Growth to study governmental and private policies affecting costs,  prices, and economic growth. It will strive also to build a better public  understanding of the conditions necessary for maintaining growth and price  stability.  
1959_93	1959_93	I take up next certain aspects of our international situation and our  programs to strengthen it.  
1959_95	1959_95	There can be no such thing as Fortress America. If ever we were reduced to  the isolation implied by that term, we would occupy a prison, not a  fortress. The question whether we can afford to help other nations that  want to defend their freedom but cannot fully do so from their own means,  has only one answer: we can and we must, we have been doing so since 1947.  
1959_103	1959_103	Private enterprise continues to make major contributions to economic  development in all parts of the world. But we have not yet marshalled the  full potential of American business for this task, particularly in  countries which have recently attained their independence. I shall present  to this Congress a program designed to encourage greater participation by  private enterprise in economic development abroad.  
1959_104	1959_104	Further, all of us know that to advance the cause of freedom we must do  much more than help build sound economies. The spiritual, intellectual, and  physical strength of people throughout the world will in the last analysis  determine their willingness and their ability to resist Communism.  
1959_109	1959_109	Because we are human we err. But as free men we are also responsible for  correcting the errors and imperfections of our ways.  
1959_112	1959_112	To protect the rights and freedoms of individual union members, including  the basic right to free and secret elections of officers.  
1959_113	1959_113	To advance true and responsible collective bargaining.  
1959_115	1959_115	The workers and the public must have these vital protections.  
1959_117	1959_117	The image of America abroad is not improved when school children, through  closing of some of our schools and through no fault of their own, are  deprived of their opportunity for an education.  
1959_118	1959_118	The government of a free people has no purpose more noble than to work for  the maximum realization of equality of opportunity under law. This is not  the sole responsibility of any one branch of our government. The judicial  arm, which has the ultimate authority for interpreting the Constitution,  has held that certain state laws and practices discriminate upon racial  grounds and are unconstitutional. Whenever the supremacy of the  Constitution of the United States is challenged I shall continue to take  every action necessary to uphold it.  
1959_119	1959_119	One of the fundamental concepts of our constitutional system is that it  guarantees to every individual, regardless of race, religion, or national  origin, the equal protection of the laws. Those of us who are privileged to  hold public office have a solemn obligation to make meaningful this  inspiring objective. We can fulfill that obligation by our leadership in  teaching, persuading, demonstrating, and in enforcing the law.  
1959_120	1959_120	We are making noticeable progress in the field of civil rights we are  moving forward toward achievement of equality of opportunity for all people  everywhere in the United States. In the interest of the nation and of each  of its citizens, that progress must continue.  
1959_122	1959_122	By moving steadily toward the goal of greater freedom under law, for our  own people, we shall be the better prepared to work for the cause of  freedom under law throughout the world.  
1959_123	1959_123	All peoples are solely tired of the fear, destruction, and the waste of  war. As never before, the world knows the human and material costs of war  and seeks to replace force with a genuine role of law among nations.  
1959_125	1959_125	Finally let us remind ourselves that Marxist scripture is not new; it is  not the gospel of the future. Its basic objective is dictatorship, old as  history. What is new is the shining prospect that man can build a world  where all can live in dignity.  
1959_126	1959_126	We seek victory not over any nation or people but over the ancient  enemies of us all; victory over ignorance, poverty, disease, and human  degradation wherever they may be found.  
1960_2	1960_2	Seven years ago I entered my present office with one long_held resolve  overriding all others. I was then, and remain now, determined that the  United States shall become an ever more potent resource for the cause of  peace realizing that peace cannot be for ourselves alone, but for peoples  everywhere. This determination is shared by the entire Congress indeed, by  all Americans.  
1960_3	1960_3	My purpose today is to discuss some features of America's position, both at  home and in her relations to others.  
1960_4	1960_4	First, I point out that for us, annual self_examination is made a definite  necessity by the fact that we now live in a divided world of uneasy  equilibrium, with our side committed to its own protection and against  aggression by the other.  
1960_5	1960_5	With both sides of this divided world in possession of unbelievably  destructive weapons, mankind approaches a state where mutual annihilation  becomes a possibility. No other fact of today's world equals this in  importance it colors everything we say, plan, and do.  
1960_6	1960_6	There is demanded of us, vigilance, determination, and the dedication of  whatever portion of our resources that will provide adequate security,  especially a real deterrent to aggression. These things we are doing.  
1960_7	1960_7	All these facts emphasize the importance of striving incessantly for a just  peace.  
1960_16	1960_16	Still another avenue may be found in the field of disarmament, in which the  Soviets have professed a readiness to negotiate seriously. They have not,  however, made clear the plans they may have, if any, for mutual inspection  and verification the essential condition for any extensive measure of  disarmament.  
1960_17	1960_17	There is one instance where our initiative for peace has recently been  successful. A multi_lateral treaty signed last month provides for the  exclusively peaceful use of Antarctica, assured by a system of inspection.  It provides for free and cooperative scientific research in that continent,  and prohibits nuclear explosions there pending general international  agreement on the subject. The Treaty is a significant contribution toward  peace, international cooperation, and the advancement of science. I shall  transmit its text to the Senate for consideration and approval in the near  future.  
1960_21	1960_21	We and our friends are, of course, concerned with self_defense. Growing out  of this concern is the realization that all people of the Free World have a  great stake in the progress, in freedom, of the uncommitted and newly  emerging nations. These peoples, desperately hoping to lift themselves to  decent levels of living must not, by our neglect, be forced to seek help  from, and finally become virtual satellites of, those who proclaim their  hostility to freedom.  
1960_22	1960_22	Their natural desire for a better life must not be frustrated by  withholding from them necessary technical and investment assistance. This  is a problem to be solved not by America alone, but also by every nation  cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help.  
1960_23	1960_23	In recent years America's partners and friends in Western Europe and Japan  have made great economic progress. Their newly found economic strength is  eloquent testimony to the striking success of the policies of economic  cooperation which we and they have pursued.  
1960_26	1960_26	America did not become great through softness and self_indulgence. Her  miraculous progress and achievements flow from other qualities far more  worthy and substantial   
1960_27	1960_27	 adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious  philosophy  
1960_28	1960_28	 a satisfaction in hard work  
1960_29	1960_29	 the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes  
1960_34	1960_34	The immediate need for this kind of cooperation is underscored by the  strain in our international balance of payments. Our surplus from foreign  business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the  expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments  overseas, to finance private investment, and to provide assistance to the  less developed nations. In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments  approached $4 billion.  
1960_35	1960_35	Continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would, over time,  impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the Free  World.  
1960_37	1960_37	New nations, and others struggling with the problems of development, will  progress only if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and possess  the will and use their own resources to fulfill it. Moreover, progress in a  national transformation can be only gradually earned; there is no easy and  quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane. But, just as we drew  on Europe for assistance in our earlier years, so now do those new and  emerging nations that have this faith and determination deserve help.  
1960_38	1960_38	Over the last fifteen years, twenty nations have gained political  independence. Others are doing so each year. Most of them are woefully  lacking in technical capacity and in investment capital; without Free World  support in these matters they cannot effectively progress in freedom.  
1960_41	1960_41	All of us must realize, of course, that development in freedom by the newly  emerging nations, is no mere matter of obtaining outside financial  assistance. An indispensable element in this process is a strong and  continuing determination on the part of these nations to exercise the  national discipline necessary for any sustained development period. These  qualities of determination are particularly essential because of the fact  that the process of improvement will necessarily be gradual and laborious  rather than revolutionary. Moreover, everyone should be aware that the  development process is no short term phenomenon. Many years are required  for even the most favorably situated countries.  
1960_42	1960_42	I shall continue to urge the American people, in the interests of their own  security, prosperity and peace, to make sure that their own part of this  great project be amply and cheerfully supported. Free World decisions in  this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world  progress in freedom.  
1960_43	1960_43	Other countries, some of which I visited last month, have similar needs.  
1960_44	1960_44	A common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared  to assist in the development effort. During the past year I have discussed  this matter with the leaders of several Western Nations.  
1960_45	1960_45	Because of its wealth of experience, the Organization for European Economic  Cooperation could help with initial studies. The goal is to enlist all  available economic resources in the industrialized Free World_especially  private investment capital. But I repeat that .this help, no matter how  great, can be lastingly effective only if it is used as a supplement to the  strength of spirit and will of the people of the newly_developing nations.  
1960_49	1960_49	No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace, we must maintain a  high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in  negotiating the issue of arms reduction. Until tangible and mutually  enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out, we will not weaken the  means of defending our institutions.  
1960_65	1960_65	 the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged  labor_management stalemate;  
1960_67	1960_67	 the continuing threat of inflation, together with the persisting tendency  toward fiscal irresponsibility;  
1960_72	1960_72	To me, it seems almost absurd for the United States to recognize the need,  and so earnestly to seek, for cooperation among the nations unless we can  achieve voluntary, dependable, abiding cooperation among the important  segments of our own free society.  
1960_73	1960_73	Failure to face up to basic issues in areas other than those of  labor_management can cause serious strains on the firm freedom supports of  our society.  
1960_74	1960_74	I refer to agriculture as one of these areas.  
1960_76	1960_76	Today our farm problem is totally different. It is that of effectively  adjusting to the changes caused by a scientific revolution. When the  original farm laws were written, an hour's farm labor produced only one  fourth as much wheat as at present. Farm legislation is woefully  out_of_date, ineffective, and expensive.  
1960_79	1960_79	Another issue that we must meet squarely is that of living within our  means. This requires restraint in expenditure, constant reassessment of  priorities, and the maintenance of stable prices.  
1960_80	1960_80	We must prevent inflation. Here is an opponent of so many guises that it is  sometimes difficult to recognize. But our clear need is to stop continuous  and general price rises a need that all of us can see and feel.  
1960_90	1960_90	This budget will help ease pressures in our credit and capital markets. It  will enhance the confidence of people all over the world in the strength of  our economy and our currency and in our individual and collective ability  to be fiscally responsible.  
1960_93	1960_93	In all our hopes and plans for a better world we all recognize that  provincial and racial prejudices must be combatted. In the long perspective  of history, the right to vote has been one of the strongest pillars of a  free society. Our first duty is to protect this right against all  encroachment. In spite of constitutional guarantees, and notwithstanding  much progress of recent years, bias still deprives some persons in this  country of equal protection of the laws.  
1960_94	1960_94	Early in your last session I recommended legislation which would help  eliminate several practices discriminating against the basic rights of  Americans. The Civil Rights Commission has developed additional  constructive recommendations. I hope that these will be among the matters  to be seriously considered in the current session. I trust that Congress  will thus signal to the world that our Government is striving for equality  under law for all our people.  
1960_95	1960_95	Each year and in many ways our nation continues to undergo profound change  and growth.  
1960_98	1960_98	By 1975 the metropolitan areas of the United States will occupy twice the  territory they do today. The roster of urban problems with which they must  cope is staggering. They involve water supply, cleaning the air, adjusting  local tax systems, providing for essential educational, cultural, and  social services, and destroying those conditions which breed delinquency  and crime.  
1960_100	1960_100	I do not doubt that our urban and other perplexing problems can be solved  in the traditional American method. In doing so we must realize that  nothing is really solved and ruinous tendencies are set in motion by  yielding to the deceptive bait of the "easy" Federal tax dollar.  
1960_103	1960_103	But the route to better trained minds is not through the swift  administration of a Federal hypodermic or sustained financial transfusion.  The educational process, essentially a local and personal responsibility,  cannot be made to leap ahead by crash, centralized governmental action.  
1960_111	1960_111	Every minute spent in irrelevant interbranch wrangling is precious time  taken from the intelligent initiation and adoption of coherent policies for  our national survival and progress.  
1960_113	1960_113	Before us and our friends is the challenge of an ideology which, for more  than four decades, has trumpeted abroad its purpose of gaining ultimate  victory over all forms of government at variance with its own.  
1960_114	1960_114	We realize that however much we repudiate the tenets of imperialistic  Communism, it represents a gigantic enterprise grimly pursued by leaders  who compel its subjects to subordinate their freedom of action and spirit  and personal desires for some hoped_for advantage in the future.  
1960_116	1960_116	The competition they provide is formidable.  
1960_118	1960_118	But we must use that capacity intelligently and tirelessly, regardless of  personal sacrifice.  
1960_119	1960_119	The fissure that divides our political planet is deep and wide.  
1960_121	1960_121	Police states are called "people's democracies."  
1960_122	1960_122	Armed conquest of free people is called "liberation."  
1960_124	1960_124	We must make clear our peaceful intentions, our aspirations for a better  world. So doing, we must use language to enlighten the mind, not as the  instrument of the studied innuendo and distorter of truth.  
1960_128	1960_128	By our every action we must strive to make ourselves worthy of this trust,  ever mindful that an accumulation of seemingly minor encroachments upon  freedom gradually could break down the entire fabric of a free society.  
1961_3	1961_3	I am confident that that friendship will continue. Our Constitution wisely  assigns both joint and separate roles to each branch of the government; and  a President and a Congress who hold each other in mutual respect will  neither permit nor attempt any trespass. For my part, I shall withhold from  neither the Congress nor the people any fact or report, past, present, or  future, which is necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and  hazards. I shall neither shift the burden of executive decisions to the  Congress, nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions.  
1961_15	1961_15	I will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to improve  unemployment compensation through temporary increases in duration on a  self_supporting basis to provide more food for the families of the  unemployed, and to aid their needy children to redevelop our areas of  chronic labor surplus to expand the services of the U.S. Employment  Offices to stimulate housing and construction to secure more purchasing  power for our lowest paid workers by raising and expanding the minimum  wage to offer tax incentives for sound plant investment to increase the  development of our natural resources to encourage price stability and to  take other steps aimed at insuring a prompt recovery and paving the way for  increased long_range growth. This is not a partisan program concentrating  on our weaknesses it is, I hope, a national program to realize our  national strength.  
1961_22	1961_22	In short, we need not and we shall not take any action to increase the  dollar price of gold from $35 an ounce to impose exchange controls to  reduce our anti_recession efforts to fall back on restrictive trade  policies or to weaken our commitments around the world.  
1961_23	1961_23	This Administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any  fashion. And this is a commitment.  
1961_24	1961_24	Prudence and good sense do require, however, that new steps be taken to  ease the payments deficit and prevent any gold crisis. Our success in world  affairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to  pay. A series of executive orders, legislative remedies and cooperative  efforts with our allies will get underway immediately aimed at attracting  foreign investment and travel to this country promoting American exports,  at stable prices and with more liberal government guarantees and  financing curbing tax and customs loopholes that encourage undue spending  of private dollars abroad and (through OECD, NATO and otherwise) sharing  with our allies all efforts to provide for the common defense of the free  world and the hopes for growth of the less developed lands. While the  current deficit lasts, ways will be found to ease our dollar outlays abroad  without placing the full burden on the families of men whom we have asked  to serve our Flag overseas.  
1961_29	1961_29	Our classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly have  room for, taught by 90,000 teachers not properly qualified to teach. One  third of our most promising high school graduates are financially unable to  continue the development of their talents. The war babies of the 1940's,  who overcrowded our schools in the 1950's, are now descending in 1960 upon  our colleges with two college students for every one, ten years from  now and our colleges are ill prepared. We lack the scientists, the  engineers and the teachers our world obligations require. We have neglected  oceanography, saline water conversion, and the basic research that lies at  the root of all progress. Federal grants for both higher and public school  education can no longer be delayed.  
1961_31	1961_31	Our supply of clean water is dwindling. Organized and juvenile crimes cost  the taxpayers millions of dollars each year, making it essential that we  have improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards. The denial of  constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of  race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturbs the national conscience,  and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not  equal to the high promise of our heritage. Morality in private business  has not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public business. A host  of problems and projects in all 50 States, though not possible to include  in this Message, deserves and will receive the attention of both the  Congress and the Executive Branch. On most of these matters, Messages will  be sent to the Congress within the next two weeks.  
1961_33	1961_33	But all these problems pale when placed beside those which confront us  around the world. No man entering upon this office, regardless of his  party, regardless of his previous service in Washington, could fail to be  staggered upon learning even in this brief 10 day period the harsh  enormity of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years.  Each day the crises multiply. Each day their solution grows more difficult.  Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger, as weapons spread and  hostile forces grow stronger. I feel I must inform the Congress that our  analyses over the last ten days make it clear that in each of the  principal areas of crisis the tide of events has been running out and time  has not been our friend.  
1961_36	1961_36	In Latin America, Communist agents seeking to exploit that region's  peaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90 miles  from our shores. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people's drive for  a better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestic  tyrannies. Cuban social and economic reform should be encouraged. Questions  of economic and trade policy can always be negotiated. But Communist  domination in this Hemisphere can never be negotiated.  
1961_37	1961_37	We are pledged to work with our sister Republics to free the Americas of  all such foreign domination and all tyranny, working toward the goal of a  free hemisphere of free governments, extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic  Circle.  
1961_39	1961_39	Our greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the Cold  War but the first great obstacle is still our relations with the Soviet  Union and Communist China. We must never be lulled into believing that  either power has yielded its ambitions for world domination ambitions  which they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, our  task is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be  profitable routes to pursue these ends. Open and peaceful competition for  prestige, for markets, for scientific achievement, even for men's minds is  something else again. For if Freedom and Communism were to compete for  man's allegiance in a world at peace, I would look to the future with ever  increasing confidence.  
1961_41	1961_41	One must not overshadow the other. On the Presidential Coat of Arms, the  American eagle holds in his right talon the olive branch, while in his left  he holds a bundle of arrows. We intend to give equal attention to both.  
1961_46	1961_46	(b) I have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine program.  Using unobligated ship_building funds now (to let contracts originally  scheduled for the next fiscal year) will build and place on station at  least nine months earlier than planned substantially more units of a  crucial deterrent a fleet that will never attack first, but possess  sufficient powers of retaliation, concealed beneath the seas, to discourage  any aggressor from launching an attack upon our security.  
1961_50	1961_50	 more flexibility for short run emergencies  
1961_54	1961_54	To our sister republics to the south, we have pledged a new alliance for  progress alianza para progreso. Our goal is a free and prosperous Latin  America, realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree of  economic and social progress that matches their historic contributions of  culture, intellect and liberty. To start this nation's role at this time in  that alliance of neighbors, I am recommending the following:  
1961_57	1961_57	 That our delegates to the OAS, working with those of other members,  strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent  foreign domination anywhere in the Hemisphere.  
1961_62	1961_62	Finally, while our attention is centered on the development of the non_  communist world, we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedom  and welfare of the Eastern European peoples. In order to be prepared to  help re_establish historic ties of friendship, I am asking the Congress  for increased discretion to use economic tools in this area whenever  this is found to be clearly in the national interest. This will require  amendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act along the lines I  proposed as a member of the Senate, and upon which the Senate voted last  summer. Meanwhile, I hope to explore with the Polish government the  possibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that  will demonstrate our abiding friendship for and interest in the people  of Poland.  
1961_63	1961_63	Third, we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools the means of  cooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must  ultimately rest.  
1961_69	1961_69	 we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the  Secretary_General is maintained.  
1961_70	1961_70	 And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of the  world to join with us in strengthening this organization, which is far  more essential to their security than it is to ours the only body in the  world where no nation need be powerful to be secure, where every nation has  an equal voice, and where any nation can exert influence not according to  the strength of its armies but according to the strength of its ideas. It  deserves the support of all.  
1961_71	1961_71	Finally, this Administration intends to explore promptly all possible areas  of cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations "to invoke the  wonders of science instead of its terrors." Specifically, I now invite all  nations including the Soviet Union to join with us in developing a  weather prediction program, in a new communications satellite program and  in preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probes  which may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the universe.  
1961_72	1961_72	Today this country is ahead in the science and technology of space, while  the Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles into  orbit. Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations by  removing these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of the  Cold War. The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet Union  and the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the fruits  of this new knowledge available to all and, beyond that, in an effort to  extend farm technology to hungry nations to wipe out disease to increase  the exchanges of scientists and their knowledge and to make our own  laboratories available to technicians of other lands who lack the  facilities to pursue their own work. Where nature makes natural allies of  us all, we can demonstrate that beneficial relations are possible even  with those with whom we most deeply disagree and this must someday be the  basis of world peace and world law.  
1961_77	1961_77	We cannot escape our dangers neither must we let them drive us into panic  or narrow isolation. In many areas of the world where the balance of power  already rests with our adversaries, the forces of freedom are sharply  divided. It is one of the ironies of our time that the techniques of a  harsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardor  in its servants while the blessings of liberty have too often stood for  privilege, materialism and a life of ease.  
1961_78	1961_78	But I have a different view of liberty.  
1961_80	1961_80	In the words of a great President, whose birthday we honor today, closing  his final State of the Union Message sixteen years ago, "We pray that we  may be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given us."  
1962_7	1962_7	At home, we began the year in the valley of recession we completed it on  the high road of recovery and growth. With the help of new Congressionally  approved or Administratively increased stimulants to our economy, the  number of major surplus labor areas has declined from 101 to 60;  non_agricultural employment has increased by more than a million jobs; and  the average factory work_week has risen to well over 40 hours. At year's  end the economy which Mr. Khrushchev once called a "stumbling horse" was  racing to new records in consumer spending, labor income, and industrial  production.  
1962_10	1962_10	(2) Second, the Youth Employment Opportunities Act, to help train and place  not only the one million young Americans who are both out of school and out  of work, but the twenty_six million young Americans entering the labor  market in this decade; and  
1962_18	1962_18	But recession is only one enemy of a free economy inflation is another.  Last year, 1961, despite rising production and demand, consumer prices held  almost steady and wholesale prices declined. This is the best record of  overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end  of World War II.  
1962_20	1962_20	Our first line of defense against inflation is the good sense and public  spirit of business and labor keeping their total increases in wages and  profits in step with productivity. There is no single statistical test to  guide each company and each union. But I strongly urge them for their  country's interest, and for their own to apply the test of the public  interest to these transactions.  
1962_24	1962_24	 We are holding the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the level  incurred after the last recession in 1958; and, finally,  
1962_26	1962_26	This is a joint responsibility, requiring Congressional cooperation on  appropriations, and on three sources of income in particular:  
1962_30	1962_30	III. GETTING AMERICA MOVING  
1962_32	1962_32	CITIES  
1962_35	1962_35	A strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources. American  farmers took heart in 1961 from a billion dollar rise in farm income and  from a hopeful start on reducing the farm surpluses. But we are still  operating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws, which cost us $1  billion a year in CCC carrying charges alone, yet fail to halt rural  poverty or boost farm earnings.  
1962_37	1962_37	I will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farm  program tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop  to the long_range needs of the sixties and designed to prevent chaos in  the sixties with a program of common sense.  
1962_41	1962_41	I issued last March a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal  employment opportunity in all Federal agencies and contractors. The Vice  President's Committee thus created has done much, including the voluntary  "Plans for Progress" which, in all sections of the country, are achieving a  quiet but striking success in opening up to all races new professional,  supervisory, and other job opportunities.  
1962_42	1962_42	But there is much more to be done by the Executive, by the courts, and by  the Congress. Among the bills now pending before you, on which the  executive departments will comment in detail, are appropriate methods of  strengthening these basic rights which have our full support. The right to  vote, for example, should no longer be denied through such arbitrary  devices on a local level, sometimes abused, such as literacy tests and poll  taxes. As we approach the 100th anniversary, next January, of the  Emancipation Proclamation, let the acts of every branch of the  Government and every citizen portray that "righteousness does exalt a  nation."  
1962_45	1962_45	Last year, we improved the diet of needy people provided more hot lunches  and fresh milk to school children built more college dormitories and, for  the elderly, expanded private housing, nursing homes, health services, and  social security. But we have just begun.  
1962_48	1962_48	To take advantage of modern vaccination achievements, I am proposing a mass  immunization program, aimed at the virtual elimination of such ancient  enemies of our children as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus.  
1962_54	1962_54	Equally important to our strength is the quality of our education. Eight  million adult Americans are classified as functionally illiterate. This is  a disturbing figure reflected in Selective Service rejection  rates reflected in welfare rolls and crime rates. And I shall recommend  plans for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy.  
1962_56	1962_56	If this Nation is to grow in wisdom and strength, then every able high  school graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talents. Yet  nearly half lack either the funds or the facilities to attend college.  Enrollments are going to double in our colleges in the short space of 10  years. The annual cost per student is skyrocketing to astronomical  levels now averaging $1,650 a year, although almost half of our families  earn less than $5,000. They cannot afford such costs but this Nation  cannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower.  
1962_57	1962_57	But excellence in education must begin at the elementary level. I sent to  the Congress last year a proposal for Federal aid to public school  construction and teachers' salaries. I believe that bill, which passed the  Senate and received House Committee approval, offered the minimum amount  required by our needs and in terms of across_the_board aid the maximum  scope permitted by our Constitution. I therefore see no reason to weaken or  withdraw that bill: and I urge its passage at this session.  
1962_58	1962_58	"Civilization," said H. G. Wells, "is a race between education and  catastrophe." It is up to you in this Congress to determine the winner of  that race.  
1962_59	1962_59	These are not unrelated measures addressed to specific gaps or grievances  in our national life. They are the pattern of our intentions and the  foundation of our hopes. "I believe in democracy," said Woodrow Wilson,  "because it releases the energy of every human being." The dynamic of  democracy is the power and the purpose of the individual, and the policy of  this administration is to give to the individual the opportunity to realize  his own highest possibilities.  
1962_60	1962_60	Our program is to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive  employment, to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational  exclusion, to offer to all the facilities for education and health and  welfare, to make society the servant of the individual and the individual  the source of progress, and thus to realize for all the full promise of  American life.  
1962_62	1962_62	All of these efforts at home give meaning to our efforts abroad. Since the  close of the Second World War, a global civil war has divided and tormented  mankind. But it is not our military might, or our higher standard of  living, that has most distinguished us from our adversaries. It is our  belief that the state is the servant of the citizen and not his master.  
1962_64	1962_64	Yet our basic goal remains the same: a peaceful world community of free and  independent states free to choose their own future and their own system,  so long as it does not threaten the freedom of others.  
1962_71	1962_71	V. OUR MILITARY STRENGTH  
1962_75	1962_75	Thus we have doubled the number of ready combat divisions in the Army's  strategic reserve increased our troops in Europe built up the  Marines added new sealift and airlift capacity modernized our weapons and  ammunition expanded our anti_guerrilla forces and increased the active  fleet by more than 70 vessels and our tactical air forces by nearly a dozen  wings.  
1962_77	1962_77	In the coming year, our reserve programs will be revised two Army  Divisions will, I hope, replace those Guard Divisions on duty and  substantial other increases will boost our Air Force fighter units, the  procurement of equipment, and our continental defense and warning efforts.  The Nation's first serious civil defense shelter program is under way,  identifying, marking, and stocking 50 million spaces; and I urge your  approval of Federal incentives for the construction of public fall_out  shelters in schools and hospitals and similar centers.  
1962_80	1962_80	In 1961 the peace_keeping strength of the United Nations was reinforced.  And those who preferred or predicted its demise, envisioning a troika in  the seat of Hammarskjold or Red China inside the Assembly have seen  instead a new vigor, under a new Secretary General and a fully independent  Secretariat. In making plans for a new forum and principles on disarmament   for peace_keeping in outer space for a decade of development effort the  UN fulfilled its Charter's lofty aim.  
1962_81	1962_81	Eighteen months ago the tangled and turbulent Congo presented the UN with  its gravest challenge. The prospect was one of chaos or certain big_power  confrontation, with all of its hazards and all of its risks, to us and to  others. Today the hopes have improved for peaceful conciliation within a  united Congo. This is the objective of our policy in this important area.  
1962_82	1962_82	No policeman is universally popular particularly when he uses his stick to  restore law and order on his beat. Those members who are willing to  contribute their votes and their views but very little else have created  a serious deficit by refusing to pay their share of special UN assessments.  Yet they do pay their annual assessments to retain their votes and a new  UN Bond issue, financing special operations for the next 18 months, is to  be repaid with interest from these regular assessments. This is clearly in  our interest. It will not only keep the UN solvent, but require all voting  members to pay their fair share of its activities. Our share of special  operations has long been much higher than our share of the annual  assessment and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionate  obligation, and for these reasons, I am urging Congress to approve our  participation.  
1962_88	1962_88	I turn now to a prospect of great promise: our Hemispheric relations. The  Alliance for Progress is being rapidly transformed from proposal to  program. Last month in Latin America I saw for myself the quickening of  hope, the revival of confidence, the new trust in our country among  workers and farmers as well as diplomats. We have pledged our help in  speeding their economic, educational, and social progress. The Latin  American Republics have in turn pledged a new and strenuous effort of  self_help and self_reform.  
1962_90	1962_90	VIII. THE NEW AND DEVELOPING NATIONS  
1962_92	1962_92	A newly conceived Peace Corps is winning friends and helping people in  fourteen countries supplying trained and dedicated young men and women, to  give these new nations a hand in building a society, and a glimpse of the  best that is in our country. If there is a problem here, it is that we  cannot supply the spontaneous and mounting demand.  
1962_94	1962_94	These programs help people; and, by helping people, they help freedom. The  views of their governments may sometimes be very different from ours but  events in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe teach us never to  write off any nation as lost to the Communists. That is the lesson of our  time. We support the independence of those newer or weaker states whose  history, geography, economy or lack of power impels them to remain outside  "entangling alliances" as we did for more than a century. For the  independence of nations is a bar to the Communists' "grand design" it is  the basis of our own.  
1962_98	1962_98	Finally, the united strength of the Atlantic Community has flourished in  the last year under severe tests. NATO has increased both the number and  the readiness of its air, ground, and naval units both its nuclear and  non_nuclear capabilities. Even greater efforts by all its members are still  required. Nevertheless our unity of purpose and will has been, I believe,  immeasurably strengthened.  
1962_102	1962_102	The emergence of the new Europe is being matched by the emergence of new  ties across the Atlantic. It is a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in  hundreds of workaday tasks: of currencies kept in effective relation, of  development loans meshed together, of standardized weapons, and concerted  diplomatic positions. The Atlantic Community grows, not like a volcanic  mountain, by one mighty explosion, but like a coral reef, from the  accumulating activity of all.  
1962_104	1962_104	X. OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  
1962_107	1962_107	We shall continue to attract foreign tourists and investments to our  shores, to seek increased military purchases here by our allies, to  maximize foreign aid procurement from American firms, to urge increased aid  from other fortunate nations to the less fortunate, to seek tax laws which  do not favor investment in other industrialized nations or tax havens, and  to urge coordination of allied fiscal and monetary policies so as to  discourage large and disturbing capital movements.  
1962_109	1962_109	Above all, if we are to pay for our commitments abroad, we must expand our  exports. Our businessmen must be export conscious and export competitive.  Our tax policies must spur modernization of our plants our wage and price  gains must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on prices our  export credit and promotion campaigns for American industries must continue  to expand.  
1962_110	1962_110	But the greatest challenge of all is posed by the growth of the European  Common Market. Assuming the accession of the United Kingdom, there will  arise across the Atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariff  similar to ours with an economy which nearly equals our own. Will we in  this country adapt our thinking to these new prospects and patterns or  will we wait until events have passed us by?  
1962_111	1962_111	This is the year to decide. The Reciprocal Trade Act is expiring. We need a  new law a wholly new approach a bold new instrument of American trade  policy. Our decision could well affect the unity of the West, the course of  the Cold War, and the economic growth of our Nation for a generation to  come.  
1962_115	1962_115	To seize that initiative, I shall shortly send to the Congress a new  five_year Trade Expansion Action, far_reaching in scope but designed with  great care to make certain that its benefits to our people far outweigh any  risks. The bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariffs here in the  United States and in the Common Market on those items in which we together  supply 80 percent of the world's trade mostly items in which our own  ability to compete is demonstrated by the fact that we sell abroad, in  these items, substantially more than we import. This step will make it  possible for our major industries to compete with their counterparts in  Western Europe for access to European consumers.  
1962_116	1962_116	On other goods the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duties up to 50  percent permitting bargaining by major categories and provide for  appropriate and tested forms of assistance to firms and employees adjusting  to import competition. We are not neglecting the safeguards provided by  peril points, an escape clause, or the National Security Amendment. Nor are  we abandoning our non_European friends or our traditional "most_favored  nation" principle. On the contrary, the bill will provide new encouragement  for their sale of tropical agricultural products, so important to our  friends in Latin America, who have long depended upon the European market,  who now find themselves faced with new challenges which we must join with  them in overcoming.  
1962_117	1962_117	Concessions, in this bargaining, must of course be reciprocal, not  unilateral. The Common Market will not fulfill its own high promise unless  its outside tariff walls are low. The dangers of restriction or timidity in  our own policy have counterparts for our friends in Europe. For together we  face a common challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of free men  everywhere to build in partnership a new trading community in which all  free nations may gain from the productive energy of free competitive  effort.  
1963_2	1963_2	I congratulate you all not merely on your electoral victory but on your  selected role in history. For you and I are privileged to serve the great  Republic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history. The  choices we make, for good or ill, may well shape the state of the Union for  generations yet to come.  
1963_3	1963_3	Little more than 100 weeks ago I assumed the office of President of the  United States. In seeking the help of the Congress and our countrymen, I  pledged no easy answers. I pledged and asked only toil and dedication.  These the Congress and the people have given in good measure. And today,  having witnessed in recent months a heightened respect for our national  purpose and power having seen the courageous calm of a united people in  a perilous hour and having observed a steady improvement in the  opportunities and well_being of our citizens I can report to you that  the state of this old but youthful Union, in the 175th year of its life,  is good.  
1963_4	1963_4	In the world beyond our borders, steady progress has been made in building  a world of order. The people of West Berlin remain both free and secure. A  settlement, though still precarious, has been reached in Laos. The  spearpoint of aggression has been blunted in Viet_Nam. The end of agony may  be in sight in the Congo. The doctrine of troika is dead. And, while danger  continues, a deadly threat has been removed in Cuba.  
1963_7	1963_7	But we cannot be satisfied to rest here. This is the side of the hill, not  the top. The mere absence of war is not peace. The mere absence of  recession is not growth. We have made a beginning but we have only begun.  
1963_11	1963_11	For this would mean tens of billions of dollars more each year in  production, profits, wages, and public revenues. It would mean an end to  the persistent slack which has kept our unemployment at or above 5 percent  for 61 out of the past 62 months and an end to the growing pressures for  such restrictive measures as the 35_hour week, which alone could increase  hourly labor costs by as much as 14 percent, start a new wage_price spiral  of inflation, and undercut our efforts to compete with other nations.  
1963_13	1963_13	For it is increasingly clear to those in Government, business, and labor  who are responsible for our economy's success that our obsolete tax system  exerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits, and  employment. Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now checks  growth instead. It discourages extra effort and risk. It distorts the use  of resources. It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our Federal  revenues, and causes chronic budget deficits.  
1963_16	1963_16	To achieve this reduction within the limits of a manageable budgetary  deficit, I urge: first, that these cuts be phased over 3 calendar years,  beginning in 1963 with a cut of some $6 billion at annual rates; second,  that these reductions be coupled with selected structural changes,  beginning in 1964, which will broaden the tax base, end unfair or  unnecessary preferences, remove or lighten certain hardships, and in the  net offset some $3.5 billion of the revenue loss; and third, that budgetary  receipts at the outset be increased by $1.5 billion a year, without any  change in tax liabilities, by gradually shifting the tax payments of large  corporations to a more current time schedule. This combined program, by  increasing the amount of our national income, will in time result in still  higher Federal revenues. It is a fiscally responsible program the surest  and the soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget in a balanced  full employment economy.  
1963_18	1963_18	I do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform is the only way to  achieve these goals.  
1963_21	1963_21	No doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxes alone  would be of great help but corporations need customers and job seekers  need jobs.  
1963_23	1963_23	And finally, there are no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax  cut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possible  an equivalent cut in expenditures but that end is not in view and to wait  for it would be costly and self_defeating.  
1963_26	1963_26	II.  
1963_30	1963_30	Therefore, by holding down the budgetary cost of existing programs to keep  within the limitations I have set, it is both possible and imperative to  adopt other new measures that we cannot afford to postpone.  
1963_38	1963_38	Moreover, all our miracles of medical research will count for little if  we cannot reverse the growing nationwide shortage of doctors, dentists, and  nurses, and the widespread shortages of nursing homes and modern urban  hospital facilities. Merely to keep the present ratio of doctors and  dentists from declining any further, we must over the next 10 years  increase the capacity of our medical schools by 50 percent and our dental  schools by 100 percent.  
1963_40	1963_40	Third, we need to strengthen our Nation by protecting the basic rights of  its citizens.  
1963_41	1963_41	The right to competent counsel must be assured to every man accused of  crime in Federal court, regardless of his means.  
1963_43	1963_43	Fourth, we need to strengthen our Nation by making the best and the most  economical use of its resources and facilities.  
1963_48	1963_48	We shall be judged more by what we do at home than by what we preach  abroad. Nothing we could do to help the developing countries would help  them half as much as a booming U.S. economy. And nothing our opponents  could do to encourage their own ambitions would encourage them half as much  as a chronic, lagging U.S. economy. These domestic tasks do not divert  energy from our security they provide the very foundation for freedom's  survival and success.  
1963_53	1963_53	Four special avenues of opportunity stand out: the Atlantic Alliance, the  developing nations, the new Sino_Soviet difficulties, and the search for  worldwide peace.  
1963_55	1963_55	First, how fares the grand alliance? Free Europe is entering into a new  phase of its long and brilliant history. The era of colonial expansion has  passed; the era of national rivalries is fading; and a new era of  interdependence and unity is taking shape. Defying the old prophecies of  Marx, consenting to what no conqueror could ever compel, the free nations  of Europe are moving toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in  every sphere of activity.  
1963_56	1963_56	For 17 years this movement has had our consistent support, both political  and economic. Far from resenting the new Europe, we regard her as a welcome  partner, not a rival. For the road to world peace and freedom is still  long, and there are burdens which only full partners can share in  supporting the common defense, in expanding world trade, in aligning our  balance of payments, in aiding the emergent nations, in concerting  political and economic policies, and in welcoming to our common effort  other industrialized nations, notably Japan, whose remarkable economic and  political development of the 1950's permits it now to play on the world  scene a major constructive role.  
1963_60	1963_60	We remain too near the Nassau decisions, and too far from their full  realization, to know their place in history. But I believe that, for the  first time, the door is open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to  become a source of confidence, instead of a cause of contention.  
1963_65	1963_65	Nevertheless it is hard for any nation to focus on an external or  subversive threat to its independence when its energies are drained in  daily combat with the forces of poverty and despair. It makes little sense  for us to assail, in speeches and resolutions, the horrors of communism, to  spend $50 billion a year to prevent its military advance and then to  begrudge spending, largely on American products, less than one_tenth of  that amount to help other nations strengthen their independence and cure  the social chaos in which communism has always thrived.  
1963_69	1963_69	I do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in this mutual effort  among our close neighbors, but the free states of this hemisphere, working  in close collaboration, have begun to make this alliance a living reality.  Today it is feeding one out of every four school age children in Latin  America an extra food ration from our farm surplus. It has distributed 1.5  million school books and is building 17,000 classrooms. It has helped  resettle tens of thousands of farm families on land they can call their  own. It is stimulating our good neighbors to more self_help and  self_reform fiscal, social, institutional, and land reforms. It is  bringing new housing and hope, new health and dignity, to millions who were  forgotten. The men and women of this hemisphere know that the alliance  cannot succeed if it is only another name for United States handouts that  it can succeed only as the Latin American nations themselves devote their  best effort to fulfilling its goals.  
1963_70	1963_70	This story is the same in Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia. Wherever  nations are willing to help themselves, we stand ready to help them build  new bulwarks of freedom. We are not purchasing votes for the cold war; we  have gone to the aid of imperiled nations, neutrals and allies alike. What  we do ask and all that we ask is that our help be used to best advantage,  and that their own efforts not be diverted by needless quarrels with other  independent nations.  
1963_71	1963_71	Despite all its past achievements, the continued progress of the Mutual  Assistance Program requires a persistent discontent with present  performance. We have been reorganizing this program to make it a more  effective, efficient instrument and that process will continue this year.  
1963_73	1963_73	Neither money nor technical assistance, however, can be our only weapon  against poverty. In the end, the crucial effort is one of purpose,  requiring the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism. And nothing  carries the spirit of this American idealism more effectively to the far  corners of the earth than the American Peace Corps.  
1963_75	1963_75	There are, in fact, nearly a million Americans serving their country and  the cause of freedom in overseas posts, a record no other people can match.  Surely those of us who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly; by  supporting our aid programs; .by opening our doors to foreign visitors and  diplomats and students; and by proving, day by day, by deed as well as  word, that we are a just and generous people.  
1963_78	1963_78	Nevertheless, while a strain is not a fracture, it is clear that the forces  of diversity are at work inside the Communist camp, despite all the iron  disciplines of regimentation and all the iron dogmatisms of ideology. Marx  is proven wrong once again: for it is the closed Communist societies, not  the free and open societies which carry within themselves the seeds of  internal disintegration.  
1963_80	1963_80	New nations asked to choose between two competing systems need only compare  conditions in East and West Germany, Eastern and Western Europe, North and  South Viet_Nam. They need only compare the disillusionment of Communist  Cuba with the promise of the Alliance for Progress. And all the world knows  that no successful system builds a wall to keep its people in and freedom  out and the wall of shame dividing Berlin is a symbol of Communist  failure.  
1963_81	1963_81	VII.  
1963_84	1963_84	But it also means improved air and missile defenses, improved civil  defense, a strengthened anti_guerrilla capacity and, of prime importance,  more powerful and flexible non_nuclear forces. For threats of massive  retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression and a line of destroyers in  a quarantine, or a division of well_equipped men on a border, may be more  useful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weapons  beyond all rational need.  
1963_90	1963_90	To achieve this end, the United States will continue to spend a greater  portion of its national production than any other people in the free world.  For 15 years no other free nation has demanded so much of itself. Through  hot wars and cold, through recession and prosperity, through the ages of  the atom and outer space, the American people have never faltered and their  faith has never flagged. If at times our actions seem to make life  difficult for others, it is only because history has made life difficult  for us all.  
1963_91	1963_91	But difficult days need not be dark. I think these are proud and memorable  days in the cause of peace and freedom. We are proud, for example, of Major  Rudolf Anderson who gave his life over the island of Cuba. We salute  Specialist James Allen Johnson who died on the border of South Korea. We  pay honor to Sergeant Gerald Pendell who was killed in Viet_Nam. They are  among the many who in this century, far from home, have died for our  country. Our task now, and the task of all Americans is to live up to their  commitment.  
1964_9	1964_9	Let us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy not  because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right.  
1964_11	1964_11	For my part, I pledge a progressive administration which is efficient, and  honest and frugal. The budget to be submitted to the Congress shortly is in  full accord with this pledge.  
1964_12	1964_12	It will cut our deficit in half from $10 billion to $4,900 million. It  will be, in proportion to our national output, the smallest budget since  1951.  
1964_15	1964_15	But it is not a standstill budget, for America cannot afford to stand  still. Our population is growing. Our economy is more complex. Our people's  needs are expanding.  
1964_17	1964_17	This budget, and this year's legislative program, are designed to help each  and every American citizen fulfill his basic hopes his hopes for a fair  chance to make good; his hopes for fair play from the law; his hopes for a  full_time job on full_time pay; his hopes for a decent home for his family  in a decent community; his hopes for a good school for his children with  good teachers; and his hopes for security when faced with sickness or  unemployment or old age. III.  
1964_20	1964_20	It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will  suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won. The richest Nation on  earth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it. One thousand  dollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return  $40,000 or more in his lifetime.  
1964_23	1964_23	The program I shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to  help that one_fifth of all American families with incomes too small to even  meet their basic needs.  
1964_27	1964_27	Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and,  above all, to prevent it. No single piece of legislation, however, is going  to suffice.  
1964_34	1964_34	We must extend the coverage of our minimum wage laws to more than 2 million  workers now lacking this basic protection of purchasing power.  
1964_38	1964_38	We must, as a part of a revised housing and urban renewal program, give  more help to those displaced by slum clearance, provide more housing for  our poor and our elderly, and seek as our ultimate goal in our free  enterprise system a decent home for every American family.  
1964_41	1964_41	These programs are obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone.  Every American will benefit by the extension of social security to cover  the hospital costs of their aged parents. Every American community will  benefit from the construction or modernization of schools, libraries,  hospitals, and nursing homes, from the training of more nurses and from the  improvement of urban renewal in public transit. And every individual  American taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the  earliest possible passage of the pending tax bill from both the new  investment it will bring and the new jobs that it will create.  
1964_42	1964_42	That tax bill has been thoroughly discussed for a year. Now we need action.  The new budget clearly allows it. Our taxpayers surely deserve it. Our  economy strongly demands it. And every month of delay dilutes its benefits  in 1964 for consumption, for investment, and for employment.  
1964_44	1964_44	I therefore urge the Congress to take final action on this bill by the  first of February, if at all possible. For however proud we may be of the  unprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last 3  years, we should not and we cannot permit it to pause.  
1964_45	1964_45	In 1963, for the first time in history, we crossed the 70 million job mark,  but we will soon need more than 75 million jobs. In 1963 our gross national  product reached the $600 billion level $100 billion higher than when we  took office. But it easily could and it should be still $30 billion higher  today than it is.  
1964_51	1964_51	All members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to  the public. All members of the public should be equally eligible for  Federal benefits that are financed by the public. All members of the public  should have an equal chance to vote for public officials and to send their  children to good public schools and to contribute their talents to the  public good.  
1964_53	1964_53	We must also lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those  who seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much needed  skills and those joining their families.  
1964_57	1964_57	First, we must maintain and our reduced defense budget will maintain that  margin of military safety and superiority obtained through 3 years of  steadily increasing both the quality and the quantity of our strategic, our  conventional, and our antiguerilla forces. In 1964 we will be better  prepared than ever before to defend the cause of freedom, whether it is  threatened by outright aggression or by the infiltration practiced by those  in Hanoi and Havana, who ship arms and men across international borders to  foment insurrection. And we must continue to use that strength as John  Kennedy used it in the Cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty to  demonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibilities of  lasting peace.  
1964_66	1964_66	Eighth, we must strengthen the ability of free nations everywhere to  develop their independence and raise their standard of living, and thereby  frustrate those who prey on poverty and chaos. To do this, the rich must  help the poor and we must do our part. We must achieve a more rigorous  administration of our development assistance, with larger roles for private  investors, for other industrialized nations, and for international agencies  and for the recipient nations themselves.  
1965_1	1965_1	On this Hill which was my home, I am stirred by old friendships.  
1965_2	1965_2	Though total agreement between the Executive and the Congress is  impossible, total respect is important.  
1965_4	1965_4	I am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new Members of this body  tonight.  
1965_5	1965_5	Twenty_eight years ago, I felt as you do now. You will soon learn that you  are among men whose first love is their country, men who try each day to do  as best they can what they believe is right.  
1965_7	1965_7	Two hundred years ago, in 1765, nine assembled colonies first joined  together to demand freedom from arbitrary power.  
1965_8	1965_8	For the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental  union of democracy in the history of man. One hundred years ago, in 1865,  following a terrible test of blood and fire, the compact of union was  finally sealed.  
1965_10	1965_10	That struggle has often brought pain and violence. It is not yet over. But  we have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in  the history of freedom.  
1965_14	1965_14	But the unity we seek cannot realize its full promise in  isolation. For today the state of the Union depends, in large measure, upon  the state of the world.  
1965_17	1965_17	Let the foes of freedom take no comfort from this. For in concert with  other nations, we shall help men defend their freedom.  
1965_21	1965_21	Our own freedom and growth have never been the final goal of the American  dream.  
1965_26	1965_26	In this period we have resolved in friendship our disputes with our  neighbors of the hemisphere, and joined in an Alliance for Progress toward  economic growth and political democracy.  
1965_30	1965_30	No longer can anyone wonder whether we are in the grip of historical decay.  We know that history is ours to make. And if there is great danger, there  is now also the excitement of great expectations.  
1965_32	1965_32	Yet we still live in a troubled and  perilous world. There is no longer a single threat. There are many. They  differ in intensity and in danger. They require different attitudes and  different answers.  
1965_38	1965_38	In Eastern Europe restless nations are slowly beginning to assert their  identity. Your Government, assisted by the leaders in American labor and  business, is now exploring ways to increase peaceful trade with these  countries and with the Soviet Union. I will report our conclusions to the  Congress.  
1965_41	1965_41	Second, our own security is tied to the peace of Asia. Twice in one  generation we have had to fight against aggression in the Far East. To  ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much larger war.  
1965_43	1965_43	What is at stake is the cause of freedom and in that cause America will  never be found wanting.  
1965_46	1965_46	With the free Republics of Latin America I have always felt and my country  has always felt very special ties of interest and affection. It will be  the purpose of my administration to strengthen these ties. Together we  share and shape the destiny of the new world. In the coming year I hope to  pay a visit to Latin America. And I will steadily enlarge our commitment to  the Alliance for Progress as the instrument of our war against poverty and  injustice in this hemisphere.  
1965_48	1965_48	This European policy is not based on any abstract design. It is based on  the realities of common interests and common values, common dangers and  common expectations. These realities will continue to have their  way especially, I think, in our expanding trade and especially in our  common defense.  
1965_50	1965_50	Free Europeans must shape the course of Europe. And, for the same reasons,  that course has been, and will be, in our interest and in the interest of  freedom.  
1965_51	1965_51	I found this truth confirmed in my talks with European leaders in the last  year. I hope to repay these visits to some of our friends in Europe this  year.  
1965_53	1965_53	We welcome them to the society of nations.  
1965_54	1965_54	We are committed to help those seeking to strengthen their own  independence, and to work most closely with those governments dedicated to  the welfare of all of their people.  
1965_57	1965_57	Finally, we renew our commitment to the continued growth and the  effectiveness of the United Nations. The frustrations of the United Nations  are a product of the world that we live in, and not of the institution  which gives them voice. It is far better to throw these differences open to  the assembly of nations than to permit them to fester in silent danger.  
1965_59	1965_59	For ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame, neither gratitude nor  obedience.  
1965_63	1965_63	For that is the world in which we will flourish and that is the world that  we mean for all men to ultimately have.  
1965_64	1965_64	TOWARD THE GREAT SOCIETY  
1965_65	1965_65	World affairs will continue to call upon our energy  and our courage.  
1965_66	1965_66	But today we can turn increased attention to the character of American  life.  
1965_77	1965_77	And like freedom itself, it will always be challenge and not fulfillment.  And tonight we accept that challenge.  
1965_80	1965_80	I propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing  diseases.  
1965_81	1965_81	I propose that we launch a national effort to make the American city a  better and a more stimulating place to live.  
1965_83	1965_83	I propose that we carry out a new program to develop regions of our country  that are now suffering from distress and depression.  
1965_86	1965_86	I propose that we honor and support the achievements of thought and the  creations of art.  
1965_87	1965_87	I propose that we make an all_out campaign against waste and inefficiency.  
1965_90	1965_90	First, to keep our economy growing;  
1965_91	1965_91	 to open for all Americans the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most  Americans;  
1965_95	1965_95	1. A GROWING ECONOMY  
1965_97	1965_97	First, we must keep our Nation prosperous. We seek full  employment opportunity for every American citizen. I will present a budget  designed to move the economy forward. More money will be left in the hands  of the consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxes. We will continue  along the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy.  
1965_102	1965_102	Finding new markets abroad for our goods depends on the initiative of  American business. But we stand ready with credit and other help to  assist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire Nation.  
1965_103	1965_103	ON THE FARMS  
1965_105	1965_105	INCREASED PROSPERITY  
1965_108	1965_108	 further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by modern  technology, for the laboring_man is an indispensable force in the American  system;  
1965_110	1965_110	 the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation  system.  
1965_111	1965_111	And as pledged in our 1960 and 1964 Democratic platforms, I will propose to  Congress changes in the Taft_Hartley Act including section 14(b). I will do  so hoping to reduce the conflicts that for several years have divided  Americans in various States of our Union.  
1965_112	1965_112	In a country that spans a continent modern transportation is vital to  continued growth.  
1965_113	1965_113	TRANSPORTATION FOR GROWTH  
1965_115	1965_115	I will ask for funds to study high_speed rail transportation between urban  centers. We will begin with test projects between Washington and Boston. On  high_speed trains, passengers could travel this distance in less than 4  hours.  
1965_116	1965_116	II. OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL  
1965_126	1965_126	THROUGH EDUCATION  
1965_127	1965_127	We begin with learning.  
1965_130	1965_130	In addition to our existing programs, I will recommend a new program for  schools and students with a first year authorization of $1,500 million.  
1965_132	1965_132	For the preschool years we will help needy children become aware of the  excitement of learning.  
1965_135	1965_135	New laboratories and centers will help our schools help them lift their  standards of excellence and explore new methods of teaching. These centers  will provide special training for those who need and those who deserve  special treatment.  
1965_136	1965_136	THROUGH BETTER HEALTH  
1965_138	1965_138	Our goal is to match the achievements of our medicine to the afflictions of  our people.  
1965_142	1965_142	Community centers can help the mentally ill and improve health care for  school_age children from poor families, including services for the mentally  retarded.  
1965_144	1965_144	The City  
1965_152	1965_152	 to train local law enforcement officers;  
1965_153	1965_153	 to put the best techniques of modern science at their disposal;  
1965_158	1965_158	Within our cities imaginative programs are needed to landscape streets and  to transform open areas into places of beauty and recreation.  
1965_165	1965_165	To develop knowledge which will enrich our lives and ensure our progress, I  will recommend programs to encourage basic science, particularly in the  universities and to bring closer the day when the oceans will supply our  growing need for fresh water.  
1965_169	1965_169	Last year we saved almost $3,500 million by eliminating waste in the  National Government.  
1965_170	1965_170	And I intend to do better this year.  
1965_171	1965_171	And very soon I will report to you on our progress and on new economies  that your Government plans to make.  
1965_172	1965_172	Even the best of government is subject to the worst of hazards.  
1965_176	1965_176	This year I speak after 1 year as President of the United States.  
1965_177	1965_177	Many of you in this Chamber are among my oldest friends. We have shared  many happy moments and many hours of work, and we have watched many  Presidents together. Yet, only in the White House can you finally know the  full weight of this Office.  
1965_181	1965_181	The answer was waiting for me in the land where I was born.  
1965_184	1965_184	And tonight that country is abundant; abundant with fruit and cattle and  goats and sheep, and there are pleasant homes and lakes and the floods are  gone.  
1965_186	1965_186	Well, they were restless, of course, and they had to be moving on. But  there was more than that. There was a dream a dream of a place where a  free man could build for himself, and raise his children to a better  life a dream of a continent to be conquered, a world to be won, a nation  to be made.  
1965_193	1965_193	It must be interpreted anew by each generation for its own needs; as I have  tried, in part, to do tonight.  
1965_195	1965_195	This, then, is the state of the Union: Free and restless, growing and full  of hope.  
1966_7	1966_7	I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full  vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law  last year.  
1966_10	1966_10	I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United  States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.  
1966_11	1966_11	I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before  attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in  America.  
1966_14	1966_14	I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all  of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal and  State jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to obstruct  public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing  discrimination in the sale and rental of housing.  
1966_30	1966_30	Workers are making more money than ever with after_tax income in the past  5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent.  
1966_32	1966_32	Corporations have greater after_tax earnings than ever in history. For the  past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year  alone they had a rise of 20 percent.  
1966_34	1966_34	I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the  Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of  payments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3  billion, or less, in 1965. This achievement has been made possible by the  patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with  your Government.  
1966_35	1966_35	We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance  of payments deficit altogether in the next year.  
1966_38	1966_38	I hope these measures will be adequate. But if the necessities of Vietnam  require it, I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for additional  appropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed.  
1966_43	1966_43	To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will  plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community  Development Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps  teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and  available medical resources.  
1966_45	1966_45	And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without  improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively  to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national  interest.  
1966_46	1966_46	Yet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge that  shared prosperity is not enough. In the midst of abundance modern man walks  oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life, and  which individual abundance alone will not overcome.  
1966_47	1966_47	We can subdue and we can master these forces bring increased meaning to  our lives if all of us, Government and citizens, are bold enough to change  old ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream is dear  enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people.  
1966_48	1966_48	This year we must continue to improve the quality of American life.  
1966_49	1966_49	Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last  year, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our  Armed Forces.  
1966_53	1966_53	Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really  more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air.  
1966_56	1966_56	Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their  streets and that right just must be secured.  
1966_59	1966_59	We must also act to prevent the deception of the American  consumer requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their  contents all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed and keeping  harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores.  
1966_60	1966_60	It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring  institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich  fertility of American political invention. We must change to master  change.  
1966_71	1966_71	In a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims could  bring decay and even disaster.  
1966_74	1966_74	In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have  extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the  largest program of economic assistance in the world.  
1966_75	1966_75	And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of  social justice.  
1966_76	1966_76	In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression in Korea  under President Truman in the Formosa Straits under President  Eisenhower in Cuba under President Kennedy and again in Vietnam.  
1966_77	1966_77	Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world  problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation. I will discuss  them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing  lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents.  
1966_83	1966_83	From the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested  on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people  advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands.  
1966_85	1966_85	We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease  and ignorance.  
1966_86	1966_86	We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great  America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries  committed to develop a modern agriculture.  
1966_88	1966_88	I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at  disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the  uncared_for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out  smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during  this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by  increasing our research and we will earmark funds to help their efforts.  
1966_99	1966_99	That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of  our policy, to defend it in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba and tonight in  Vietnam.  
1966_100	1966_100	For tonight, as so many nights before, young Americans struggle and young  Americans die in a distant land.  
1966_103	1966_103	Each time they have answered. They have answered with all the effort that  the security and the freedom of this Nation required.  
1966_104	1966_104	And they do again tonight in Vietnam. Not too many years ago Vietnam was a  peaceful, if troubled, land. In the North was an independent Communist  government. In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the  friendly help of the United States.  
1966_106	1966_106	As the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear. We could leave,  abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we  could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam. We stayed.  
1966_107	1966_107	And we will stay until aggression has stopped.  
1966_114	1966_114	The enemy is no longer close to victory. Time is no longer on his side.  There is no cause to doubt the American commitment.  
1966_118	1966_118	Able and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of America, more  than 40 countries. We have talked to more than a hundred governments, all  113 that we have relations with, and some that we don't. We have talked to  the United Nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any  contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace.  
1966_120	1966_120	We seek neither territory nor bases, economic domination or military  alliance in Vietnam. We fight for the principle of self_determination that  the people of South Vietnam should be able to choose their own course,  choose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without  fear.  
1966_121	1966_121	The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question  of reunification.  
1966_123	1966_123	We have also made it clear from Hanoi to New York that there are no  arbitrary limits to our search for peace. We stand by the Geneva Agreements  of 1954 and 1962. We will meet at any conference table, we will discuss any  proposals four points or fourteen or forty and we will consider the views  of any group. We will work for a cease_fire now or once discussions have  begun. We will respond if others reduce their use of force, and we will  withdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is securely guaranteed the right  to shape its own future.  
1966_128	1966_128	I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this  conflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future  may require. We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard  conference, or even both at once.  
1966_129	1966_129	Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear. We will act  as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South  Vietnam. We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither  increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger.  
1966_132	1966_132	And let me be absolutely clear: The days may become months, and the months  may become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to  battle.  
1966_134	1966_134	The people of Vietnam, North and South, seek the same things: the shared  needs of man, the needs for food and shelter and education the chance to  build and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of  battle the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own  destiny. For many painful years, in war and revolution and infrequent  peace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs.  
1966_136	1966_136	To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight:  Let us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace, and beyond  that, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and life is the  servant of life.  
1966_140	1966_140	How many men who listen to me tonight have served their Nation in other  wars? How very many are not here to listen?  
1966_147	1966_147	The work must be our work now. Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with  whatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with our  mortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth.  
1967_8	1967_8	As President Abraham Lincoln said, "We must ask where we are, and whither  we are tending." I.  
1967_9	1967_9	The last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better  country.  
1967_12	1967_12	We have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it.  Three and one_half million Americans have already received treatment under  Medicare since July.  
1967_14	1967_14	We have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum  wage.  
1967_15	1967_15	We have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1  million Americans.  
1967_17	1967_17	We have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the  Neighborhood Youth Corps or through Head Start, a chance to learn.  
1967_18	1967_18	So together we have tried to meet the needs of our people. And, we have  succeeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few. Now we  must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress,  or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been abandoned  now by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through.  
1967_19	1967_19	I believe that our people do not want to quit though the task is great,  the work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or  months, but of years and sometimes it may be even decades. II.  
1967_22	1967_22	Three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social  progress. This required trial and error and it has produced both. But as  we learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy and we  are trying to improve our tactics. In the long run, these starts some  rewarding, others inadequate and disappointing are crucial to SUCCESS.  
1967_25	1967_25	Many listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few  understood what was required and did anything about it. The executive  branch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action  on that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great President  presented. And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress joined with me  in a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, "It will not be a short  or easy struggle no single weapon... will suffice but we shall not rest  until that war is won."  
1967_26	1967_26	And I have come here to renew that pledge tonight.  
1967_33	1967_33	I have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different  reorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this  Government, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments.  
1967_36	1967_36	This is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government. Every program  will be thoroughly evaluated. Grant_in_aid programs will be improved and  simplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our  Governors.  
1967_41	1967_41	Federal energy is essential. But it is not enough. Only a total working  partnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed. The  test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization,  each private institution, and each responsible citizen.  
1967_42	1967_42	Each State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for government  in today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive department, and  as I see you are examining yours. Some will need to reorganize and reshape  their methods of administration as we are doing. Others will need to revise  their constitutions and their laws to bring them up to date as we are  doing. Above all, I think we must work together and find ways in which the  multitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more  efficiently.  
1967_43	1967_43	During the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments  about $40 billion in grants_in_aid. This year alone, 70 percent of our  Federal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the  State and local governments. With Federal assistance, State and local  governments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion annually. These  enormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and effectively. We intend to  work closely with the States and the localities to do exactly that.  
1967_48	1967_48	We should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3 years  old, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the  early years.  
1967_51	1967_51	Let us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in their  Nation's progress.  
1967_55	1967_55	We should embark upon a major effort to provide self_help assistance to the  forgotten in our midst the American Indians and the migratory farm  workers. And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those  who live in rural poverty.  
1967_58	1967_58	We should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the  landmark Model Cities program. I intend to seek for this effort, this year,  the full amount that you in Congress authorized last year.  
1967_61	1967_61	We should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign for  a beautiful America to dean up our towns, to make them more beautiful, our  cities, our countryside, by creating more parks, and more seashores, and  more open spaces for our children to play in, and for the generations that  come after us to enjoy.  
1967_63	1967_63	We should modernize our Selective Service System. The National Commission  on Selective Service will shortly submit its report. I will send you new  recommendations to meet our military manpower needs. But let us resolve  that this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws as fair and as  effective as possible.  
1967_64	1967_64	We should protect what Justice Brandeis called the "right most valued by  civilized men" the right to privacy. We should outlaw all  wiretapping public and private wherever and whenever it occurs, except  when the security of this Nation itself is at stake and only then with the  strictest governmental safeguards. And we should exercise the full reach of  our constitutional powers to outlaw electronic "bugging" and "snooping."  
1967_71	1967_71	The 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the  Law Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended. We appointed the  National Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the  best ways to carry that attack forward.  
1967_77	1967_77	 90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master  plans, to combat crime in their area;  
1967_78	1967_78	 60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing instant  communications and special alarm systems, and introducing the latest  equipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on  crime;  
1967_82	1967_82	Many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have  already been laid. Some will necessarily be small at first, but "every  beginning is a consequence." If we postpone this urgent work now, it will  simply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher price.  
1967_87	1967_87	 Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent;  
1967_91	1967_91	Since Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to  avoid imposing them. We believe that we have done better, but we make no  pretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished.  
1967_92	1967_92	Our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive  rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit. They imposed very  severe and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home builders,  and all those associated with the home industry.  
1967_94	1967_94	As 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored. Wholesale  prices are lower tonight than they were in August. So are retail food  prices. Monetary conditions are also easing. Most interest rates have  retreated from their earlier peaks. More money now seems to be available.  
1967_95	1967_95	Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly  seek, I am confident that this movement can continue. I pledge the American  people that I will do everything in a President's power to lower interest  rates and to ease money in this country. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board  tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to  savings and loan associations an additional $1 billion, and will lower from  6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans.  
1967_96	1967_96	We shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that  we believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals;  that will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam and the  progress of our people at home; that will support a significant improvement  in our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier credit and  toward lower interest rates.  
1967_100	1967_100	For fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion. And with  the tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we estimate  revenues will be $126.9 billion. The deficit then will be $8.1 billion.  
1967_104	1967_104	Let us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve the  quality of life for every American not just the rich, not just the poor,  but every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours.  
1967_106	1967_106	We just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this  country in these years. Our children's children will pay the price if we  are not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to stand  up and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us.  III.  
1967_107	1967_107	Abroad, as at home, there is also risk in change. But abroad, as at home,  there is a greater risk in standing still. No part of our foreign policy is  so sacred that it ever remains beyond review. We shall be flexible where  conditions in the world change and where man's efforts can change them for  the better.
